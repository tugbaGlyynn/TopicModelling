It was produced as part of the Harvard-Peabody Expedition to study the highlands of New Guinea, at that time one of the only remaining areas in the world uncolonized by Europeans. The film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. The film's title is borrowed from a Dani fable that Gardner recounts in voice-over. The Dani people, whom Gardner identifies mysteriously as \"a mountain people,\" believe that there was once a great race between a bird and a snake, which was to determine the lives of human beings. Should men shed their skins and live forever like snakes, or die like birds? The bird won the race, dictating that man must die. The film's plot revolves around two characters, Weyak and Pua.

The House in the Middle is a 1954 short documentary film produced by the Federal Civil Defense Administration and the National Clean Up-Paint Up-Fix Up Bureau, which attempted to show that a clean, freshly painted house is more likely to survive a nuclear attack than its poorly maintained counterpart.

John Joseph Dunn (October 6, 1872 \u2013 October 22, 1928) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball at the turn of the 20th century who later went on to become a minor league baseball club owner. Dunn was born in Meadville, Pennsylvania and grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey. When he was nine, a boxcar ran over his left arm while playing at a local railway. He was told by doctors that his arm had to be either amputated or risk death. He declined an amputation, but his arm was left crippled from above the elbow and couldn't lift the arm above his neck. In 1896 he played for Toronto in the Eastern League, and the following year he reached the major leagues as a pitcher for the Brooklyn Bridegrooms. He bounced around the majors for seven years, having one good season with the Bridegrooms in 1899, with a 23-13 record. When he wasn't playing, Dunn studied how the game worked from the sidelines. He was also a shortstop and right fielder. After 1904, he pitched and managed in the minors for a few seasons, winning an International League pennant in 1905. In 1907, Dunn took over as manager of the Baltimore Orioles, a minor league club with no connection to the current major league team by that name. He bought the team a year later with a $10,000 loan from Philadelphia Athletics owner/manager Connie Mack and developed a minor league powerhouse by scouting and developing his own players. He signed players by how they looked instead of skill, sometimes never seeing a player play before offering a contract. Dunn first achieved renown in 1914, when his Orioles were running away with the league pennant but losing money at the box office because of a rival Federal League team in town purporting to be a major league club. To make his payroll, Dunn had to move the team to Richmond, Virginia and sell off his star player, Babe Ruth, and 11 other players to the majors. He later said that selling Ruth was his biggest regret. The team moved back to Baltimore in 1916, and Dunn again put together a juggernaut, ultimately signing 10 more players who went on to have solid major league careers. The best of these was pitcher Lefty Grove, who went 109\u201336 as an Oriole between 1920 and 1924. By that time, Dunn's team was in the midst of winning seven straight International League championships, many by huge margins. Dunn's team was regarded as the equal of many major league teams, and he kept them so by refusing to trade or sell players to the majors. It wasn't until the 1925 off-season, when the other, struggling teams in the league made an agreement with the majors on a set price for transferring players, that Dunn finally relented and began selling his stars for money. His team won one more league title in 1925 and then dropped back into the pack. Dunn was indirectly responsible for Ruth's famous nickname, with Ruth's teammates referring to him as \"Dunn's $10,000 Babe\" for the price he drew, and in addition to Grove, discovered other quality major leaguers such as Jack Bentley, Ernie Shore, George Earnshaw, Dick Porter and Tommy Thomas. Dunn ran the Orioles until his death from a heart attack in 1928.

Human Remains is a 1998 short documentary film about the personal lives of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Francisco Franco and Mao Zedong. It was written and directed by filmmaker Jay Rosenblatt and won a Sundance Award. Human Remains is a haunting documentary which illustrates the banality of evil by creating intimate portraits of five of this century\u2019s most reviled dictators. The film unveils the personal lives of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Francisco Franco and Mao Tse Tung. We learn the private and mundane details of their everyday lives -- their favorite foods, films, habits and sexual preferences. There is no mention of their public lives or of their place in history. The intentional omission of the horrors for which these men were responsible hovers over the film. Human Remains addresses this horror from a completely different angle. Irony and even occasional humor are sprinkled throughout the documentary. This darkly poetic film is based entirely on fact, creatively combining direct quotes and biographical research. Though based on historical figures, Human Remains is contemporary in its implications and ultimately invites the viewer to confront the nature of evil.

Rock impresario Bill Graham said of Money \"Eddie Money has it all... Not only can he sing, write and play, but he is a natural performer. \" After becoming a police officer, like his father, during the late 1960s, Money began to be interested in music, and eventually ended his law enforcement career in favor of becoming a musician. He moved to Berkeley, California and became a regular at area clubs, where he eventually got enough attention to secure a recording contract with Columbia Records. Later in the 1970s, he charted with singles such as \"Baby Hold On\" and \"Two Tickets to Paradise\". Money continued his successes and took advantage of the MTV music video scene in the early 1980s with his humorous narrative videos for \"Shakin'\" and \"Think I'm in Love\", but his career began to fail him after several unsuccessful releases in the mid-1980s, accompanied by his struggles with drug addiction. Money made a comeback two years later in 1986 and returned to the mainstream rock spotlight with the album Can't Hold Back, which featured a Ronnie Spector duet with \"Take Me Home Tonight\", which reached the Top 10, along with the hit \"I Wanna Go Back\". Money followed the album with another Top 10 hit, late 1988's \"Walk on Water\", but his Top 40 career ended when \"I'll Get By\" charted in 1992. During the 1990s and 2000s, Money continued to release numerous compilation albums along with several albums featuring new material. Today, he still tours the \"Oldies\" circuit regularly, often accompanied by other successful rock acts from his era, and has also made several television appearances on American sitcoms.

Carpenteria californica, the sole species in the genus Carpenteria, is an evergreen shrub native to California. It is closey related to the genus Philadelphus. Common names include Tree-anemone and Bush-anemone. It is a rare species, endemic to only seven sites in Fresno and Madera Counties, where it grows in chaparral between 340-1340 m altitude between the San Joaquin and King rivers. It is well adapted to wildfire, reproducing by stump sprouts after burning; natural seedlings are rare. It grows to 1-3 m tall, with flaky bark on older stems. The leaves are opposite, lanceolate, 4-10 cm long and 1-2.5 cm broad, glossy green above, blue-green to whitish and downy beneath. The flowers are 3-7 cm diameter, with 5-8 pure white petals and a cluster of yellow stamens; flowering is from late spring to mid summer. The fruit is a leathery capsule 6-12 mm diameter, containing numerous seeds. It is a popular ornamental plant in gardens with Mediterranean climates, grown for its decorative flowers; it is now much more common in cultivation than in the wild. Several cultivars have been selected, including 'Bodnant' (a cold-tolerant cultivar hardy to -15\u00B0C in the British Isles) and 'Ladham's' with large flowers. Note that Carpenteria should not be confused with the similarly spelled Carpentaria, a genus of palms native to northern Australia.

Frederic Edwin Church (May 4, 1826 &ndash; April 7, 1900) was an American landscape painter born in Hartford, Connecticut. He was a central figure in the Hudson River School of American landscape painters. While committed to the natural sciences, he was \"always concerned with including a spiritual dimension in his works\". The family wealth came from Church's father, Joseph Church, a silversmith and watchmaker in Hartford, Connecticut. (Joseph subsequently also became an official and a director of The Aetna Life Insurance Company) Joseph, in turn, was the son of Samuel Church, who founded the first paper mill in Lee, Massachusetts in the Berkshires, and this allowed him(Frederic) to pursue his interest in art from a very early age. At eighteen years of age, Church became the pupil of Thomas Cole in Catskill, New York after Daniel Wadsworth, a family neighbor and founder of the Wadsworth Atheneum, introduced the two. In May 1848, Church was elected as the youngest Associate of the National Academy of Design and was promoted to Academician the following year. Soon after, he sold his first major work to Hartford's Wadsworth Atheneum. Church settled in New York where he taught his first pupil, William James Stillman. From the spring to autumn each year Church would travel, often by foot, sketching. He returned each winter to paint and to sell his work. In 1853 and 1857, Church traveled in South America. One trip was financed by businessman Cyrus West Field, who wished to use Church's paintings to lure investors to his South American ventures. Church was inspired by the Prussian explorer Alexander von Humboldt's Cosmos and his exploration of the continent; Humboldt had challenged artists to portray the \"physiognomy\" of the Andes. Two years after returning to America, Church painted The Heart of the Andes (1859), now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, at the Tenth Street Studio in New York City. It is more than five feet high and nearly ten feet in length (167.9 \u00D7 302.9 cm). Church unveiled the painting to an astonished public in New York City in 1859. The painting's frame had drawn curtains fitted to it, creating the illusion of a view out a window. The audience sat on benches to view the piece and Church strategically darkened the room, but spotlighted the landscape painting. Church also brought plants from a past trip to South America to heighten the viewers' experience. The public were charged admission and provided with opera glasses to examine the painting's details. The work was an instant success. Church eventually sold it for $10,000, at that time the highest price ever paid for a work by a living American artist. Church showed his paintings at the annual exhibitions of the National Academy of Design, the American Art Union, and at the Boston Art Club, alongside Thomas Cole, Asher Brown Durand, John F. Kensett, and Jasper F. Cropsey. Critics and collectors appreciated the new art of landscape on display, and its progenitors came be to called the Hudson River School. In 1860 Church bought a farm in Hudson, New York and married Isabel Carnes. Both Church's first son and daughter died in March, 1865 of diphtheria, but he and his wife started a new family with the birth of Frederic Joseph in 1866. When he and his wife had a family of four children, they began to travel together. In 1867 they visited Europe and the Middle East, allowing Church to return to painting larger works. Before leaving on that trip, Church purchased the eighteen acres (73,000 m\u00B2) on the hilltop above his Hudson farm\u2014land he had long wanted because of its magnificent views of the Hudson River and the Catskills. In 1870 he began the construction of a Persian-inspired mansion on the hilltop and the family moved into the home in the summer of 1872. Richard Morris Hunt was the architect for Cosy Cottage at Olana, and was consulted early on in the plans for the mansion, but after the Church's trip to Europe and what is now Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Syria, Jordan and Egypt, the English architect Calvert Vaux was hired to complete the project. Church was deeply involved in the process, even completing his own architectural sketches for its design. This highly personal and eclectic castle incorporated many of the design ideas that he had acquired during his travels. Olana State Historic Site is now owned and operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Taconic Region and receives extensive support from The Olana Partnership, a private, non-profit organization. The main house is open to the public for guided tours. A visitor center offers a film and panel exhibit as well as a Museum Shop, operated by The Olana Partnership, offering books and many items inspired by the exotic locales of Church\u2019s travels and paintings. The grounds are open year-round, 8am-sunset, for hiking, picnicking, snowshoeing or just enjoying the view.
Albert Herter (1871-1950) was an artist and painter. He was born in New York, New York, and studied in Paris and then in New York's Art Students League. He had come from an artistic family; before Albert was born, his father, Christian Herter, and his father's half-brother Gustave formed Herter Brothers, a prominent New York interior design and furnishings firm. Albert Herter's paintings include Young Girl, Garden of the Hesperides, and Still Life with Flowering Dogwood and Japanese Figurines; he was commissioned to execute many portrait paintings and he created a number of civic and private murals. He married fellow artist Adele McGinnis. Their son Christian Herter became a famous politician, rising to Governor of Massachusetts and then Secretary of State under Dwight D. Eisenhower.
David Rose (June 15, 1910 &ndash; August 23, 1990) was a British-born American songwriter, composer, arranger, pianist, and orchestra leader. His most famous compositions were \"The Stripper\", \"Holiday for Strings\", and \"Calypso Melody\". He also wrote music for the television series Little House on the Prairie and Bonanza. In addition, Rose was musical director for the Red Skelton show during its 21-year-run on the CBS and NBC networks. He was a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music. Recipient of four Emmy awards, David Rose was born in London to Jewish parents and raised in Chicago, Illinois. It was here, in the early 1930s, that he first gained a reputation, while arranging for the Frank Trumbauer orchestra and later leading a house band at station WGN. He composed several now-forgotten early swing originals such as Break It Down, Transcontinental, Plantation Moods, and a piece recorded under three different titles: I've Got It, Itchola, and Jigsaw Rhythm, his original version with the WGN band including Louis Prima. He was married on October 8, 1938, to the actress Martha Raye. They were divorced on May 19, 1941. He was married for a second time, on July 28, 1941, to the actress and singer Judy Garland. They had no children, though Garland reportedly underwent at least one abortion during the marriage, at the insistence of her mother, her husband, and the studio that employed her, MGM. Garland and Rose divorced in 1944. He had two daughters with his third wife, Betty Bartholomew. His granddaughter is singer-songwriter Samantha James. Rose was a live steam hobbyist, with his own backyard railroad. Rose died in Burbank, California at the age of 80 and was buried in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Hollywood Hills, California. \"The Stripper\" was composed by Rose and recorded in 1958. It was not until its use in the movie Gypsy in 1962 that it became a smash hit, as it was originally used as a throwaway B side to his single, Ebb Tide. \"The Stripper\" features especially prominent trombone lines, giving the tune its lascivious signature, and evokes the feel of music used to accompany vaudeville striptease artists. The piece features in the films Slap Shot, The Full Monty and Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit as well as TV series Little Britain and Scrubs. It was also famously used in a parody by British comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, where they danced to the tune while making breakfast. It also is often used in cartoons and sitcoms when an attractive female enters a room. \"Holiday for Strings\" became well-known as the theme for Red Skelton's programs. A parody version, retitled \"Holiday for States\", was recorded as a vocal by Allan Sherman, with the straight melody but with ersatz lyrics comprised solely of the names of the American states. In Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, Ruth Buzzi \"laughed\" the melody of the song, imitating the Spike Jones version.

Robert N. \"Rob\" Buck (August 1, 1958, Jamestown, New York \u2013 December 19, 2000, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) was a founding member and guitarist of 10,000 Maniacs from 1981 until his death in 2000 of liver failure. Some of his compositions with Natalie Merchant are among the most popular songs recorded by 10,000 Maniacs, including What's the Matter Here?, Hey Jack Kerouac, You Happy Puppet and These Are Days. He also played in the short-lived Texas-based superstar-band League of Blind Women, writing much of the band's material. In 2000, while on tour in upstate New York, he was rushed to hospital when it was discovered he was suffering from acute liver disease. He was transferred to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center for treatment where his condition soon worsened despite the efforts of the leading transplant teams at the facility.
Intermedia was a concept employed in the mid-sixties by Fluxus artist Dick Higgins to describe the ineffable, often confusing, inter-disciplinary activities that occur between genres that became prevalent in the 1960s. Thus, the areas such as those between drawing and poetry, or between painting and theater could be described as intermedia. With repeated occurrences, these new genres between genres could develop their own names Higgins described the tendency of the most interesting and best in the new art to cross the boundaries of recognized media or even to fuse the boundaries of art with media that had not previously been considered art forms, including computers. With characteristic modesty, he often noted that Samuel Taylor Coleridge had first used the term. In 1968, Hans Breder founded the first university program in the United States to offer an M.F.A. in intermedia. The Intermedia Area at The University of Iowa graduated artists such as Ana Mendieta and Charles Ray. In addition, the program developed a substantial visiting artist tradition, bringing artists such as Dick Higgins, Vito Acconci, Allan Kaprow, Karen Finley, Robert Wilson and others to work directly with Intermedia students. Over the years, especially on the Iowa campus, \"Intermedia\" has been used interchangeably with \"Multi-media. \" However, recently the latter term has become identified electronic media in pop-culture. While Intermedia values both disciplines, the term \"Intermedia\" has become the preferred term for interdisciplinary practice. Two other prominent University programs focusing on \"Intermedia\" practice are the Intermedia program at Arizona State University and the Intermedia M.F.A. at the University of Maine, founded and directed by Fluxus scholar and author Owen Smith.
Sidney Luckman, known as Sid Luckman, (November 21, 1916 \u2013 July 5, 1998) was an American football quarterback for the Chicago Bears from 1939 to 1950. During his 12 seasons with the Bears he led them to four NFL championships. Luckman was the first modern T-formation quarterback and is considered the greatest long range passer of his time. He was named the National Football League's Most Valuable Player in 1943, and Pulitzer prize winning sports writer Ira Berkow later wrote that Luckman was \"the first great T-formation quarterback\". Following his retirement from playing, Luckman continued his association with football by tutoring college coaches, focusing on the passing aspect of the game. He was later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1965, and in 1988 he was declared a joint winner of the Walter Camp Distinguished American Award.

Carolyn Merchant is an American ecofeminist philosopher and historian of science most famous for her theory (and book of the same title) on 'The Death of Nature', whereby she identifies the Enlightenment as the period when science began to atomize, objectify and dissect nature, foretelling its eventual conception as inert. Her works were important in the development of environmental history and the history of science. She writes, \"The female earth was central to organic cosmology that was undermined by the Scientific Revolution and the rise of a market-oriented culture... for sixteenth-century Europeans the root metaphor binding together the self, society and the cosmos was that of an organism... organismic theory emphasized interdependence among the parts of the human body, subordination of individual to communal purposes in family, community, and state, and vital life permeate the cosmos to the lowliest stone. \" Merchant tells us that prior to the Enlightenment, Nature was conceived of as the benevolent mother of all things, albeit sometimes wild. This metaphor was to gradually be replaced by the 'dominion' model as the Scientific Revolution rationalized and dissected nature to show all her secrets. As nature revealed her secrets, so too she was able to be controlled. Both this intention and the metaphor of 'nature unveiled' is still prevalent in scientific language. Conceptions of the Earth as nurturing bringer of life began slowly to change to one of a resource to be exploited as science became more and more confident that human minds could know all there was about the natural world and thereby affect changes on it at will. Merchant cites Francis Bacon's use of female metaphors to describe the exploitation of nature at this time was telling: \"she is either free,... or driven out of her ordinary course by the perverseness, insolence and frowardness of matter and violence of impediments... or she is put in constraint, molded and made as it were new by art and the hand of man; as in things artificial... nature takes orders from man and works under his authority\" . Nature must be \"bound into service\" and made a slave to the human ends of regaining our dominion over nature lost in the 'fall from grace' in Eden. In combination with increasing industrialization and the rise of capitalism that simultaneously replaced women's work like weaving with machinery, and subsumed their roles as subsistence agriculturists also drove people to live in cities, further removing them from nature and the effects of industrialised production on it. The combined effects of industrialization, scientific exploration of nature and the ascendancy of the dominion/domination metaphor over the nurturing Mother Earth one, according to Merchant, can still be felt in social and political thought, as much as it was evident in the art, philosophy and science of the 16th century.

Morris Lapidus (November 25, 1902 &ndash; January 18, 2001) was the architect of curvy, flamboyant Neo-baroque modern hotels that defined the 1950s 'Miami Beach' resort hotel style. Born in Odessa in the Russian Empire his Orthodox Jewish family fled Russian pogroms to New York when he was an infant. As a young man, Lapidus toyed with theatrical set design and studied architecture at Columbia University. Lapidus worked for the prominent Beaux Arts firm of Warren and Wetmore. He then worked independently for 20 years as a retail architect before being approached to design vacation hotels on Miami Beach. After a career in retail interior design, his first large commission was the Miami Beach Sans Souci Hotel, followed closely by the Nautilus, the Di Lido, the Biltmore Terrace, and the Algiers, all along Collins Avenue, and amounting to the single-handed redesign of an entire district. The hotels were an immediate popular success. Then in 1952 he landed the job of the largest luxury hotel in Miami Beach, the property he is most associated with, the Fontainebleau Hotel, which was followed the next year by the equally successful Eden Roc and the Americana (later the Sheraton Bal Harbour) in 1956. The Sheraton was demolished by implosion shortly after dawn on Sunday, November 18, 2007. In 1955 Lapidus created the Ponce de Leon Shopping Center near the plaza in St. Augustine, the Nation's Oldest City. The anchor store, Woolworth's, was the scene of the first sit-in by black demonstrators from Florida Memorial College in March, 1960, and in 1963 four young teenagers, who came to be known as the \"St. Augustine Four\" were arrested at the same place and spent the next six months in jail and reform school, until national protests forced their release by the governor and cabinet of Florida in January 1964. Martin Luther King hailed them as \"my warriors. \" The Woolworth's door-handles remain as a reminder of the event, and a Freedom Trail marker has been placed on the building by ACCORD, in its efforts to preserve the historic sites of the civil rights movement. The Lapidus style is idiosyncratic and immediately recognizable in photographs, derived as it was from the attention-getting techniques of commercial store design: sweeping curves, theatrically backlit floating ceilings, 'beanpoles', and the ameboid shapes that he called 'woggles', 'cheeseholes', and painter's palette shapes. His many smaller projects give Miami Beach's Collins Avenue its style, anticipating post-modernism. Beyond visual style, there is some degree of functionalism at work. His curving walls caught the prevailing ocean breezes in the era before central air-conditioning, and the sequence of his interior spaces were the result of careful attention to user experience: Lapidis heard complaints of endless featureless hotel corridors and when possible would curve his hallways to avoid the effect. The Fontainbleau was built on the site of the Harvey Firestone estate and defining the new Gold Coast of Miami Beach. The hotel provided locations for the 1960 Jerry Lewis film The Bellboy, a success for both Lewis and Lapidus, and the James Bond thriller Goldfinger (1964). Its most famous feature is the 'Staircase to Nowhere', which merely led to a coat check but offered the opportunity to make a glittering descent into the lobby. \"My whole success is I've always been designing for people, first because I wanted to sell them merchandise. Then when I got into hotels, I had to rethink, what am I selling now? You're selling a good time. \" His son, architect Alan Lapidus, who worked with his father for 18 years, said, \"His theory was if you create the stage setting and it's grand, everyone who enters will play their part. \" Lapidus' wife of 63 years, Beatrice, died in 1992. He died nine years later, at the age of 98 in Miami Beach, Florida.

John Banvard (November 15, 1815 \u2013 May 16, 1891) was a U.S. panorama and portrait painter known for his panoramic views of the Mississippi River Valley. John Banvard was born in New York and was educated in high school. When his father went bankrupt, he began to travel around the United States, and supported himself with paintings he exhibited. In 1840 he began to paint large panoramas of the whole Mississippi River valley. He traveled through the area in a boat, made preliminary drawings and supported himself with paintings and hunting. He combined the preliminary sketches and transferred them to a canvas in a building erected for this purpose in Louisville, Kentucky. His largest panorama began as 12 feet (3,6 m) high and 1300 feet (369 m) long and was eventually expanded to about half a mile (about 800 meters) although it was advertised as a \"three-mile canvas\". It toured around the nation, and was eventually cut up in to hundreds of pieces, none of which still exist today. In 1846 he began to travel with this panorama in Europe, Asia and Africa and even gave Queen Victoria a private viewing. During his travels he also painted panoramas in Palestine and the Nile River Valley. On his return his invested part of the fortune he had made in 60 acres overlooking Cold Spring Harbor on the North Shore of Long Island, where in 1852-55, in competition with P. T. Barnum's palace \"Iranistan\" in Bridgeport, Connecticut, he proceeded to design and have built a baronial residence from its eastern shore, which, it was given out, was intended to resemble Windsor Castle; he named the place Glenada, the glen of his daughter Ada, but the locals called it \"Banvard's Folly\". After his death it became a fashionable resort hotel, The Glenada. The Brooklyn-based history band Pinataland recorded a song about Banvard's travails for their 2008 album \"Songs for the Forgotten Future Vol. 2\".
Hugh Charles Troy, Jr. (1906 - 1964) was a US painter who is noted for his pranks.

Troy attended Cornell as an architecture student from 1922 to 1927, although he was suspended without receiving a degree due to a particular joke that offended the administration. Although many of his practical jokes on campus are legendary, university historians have been unable to prove their truthfulness and some suspect the majority of his tales to be exaggerated or entirely fabricated. After serving in the military in World War II, he made his living as an illustrator for books and magazines, authoring three children's stories. He died in 1964.

Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on Great Spruce Head Island, Maine. His painterly vision which encompassed a fascination with nature and the ability to reveal extraordinariness in ordinary life was heavily indebted to the French painters Pierre Bonnard and Edouard Vuillard. He said once, \"When I paint, I think that what would satisfy me is to express what Bonnard said Renoir told him: make everything more beautiful.\"

George Thornton Emmons (June 6, 1852 \u2013 June 11, 1945) was an ethnographic photographer and a U.S. Navy Lieutenant. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His father was George Foster Emmons. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1874. In 1881, he attained the master rank, (1883) lieutenant j.g. and (1887) lieutenant. Emmons got stationed in 1882 on the Pinta in Alaska and stayed there through the 1880s and 1890s. The navy took largely the responsibility for stability in the region, in those times. Emmons married Kittie Baker in 1886. Through his duties, Emmons got in contact with, and interested in, the Alaska Native cultures of the region: particularly the Tlingit and Tahltan. He began to record information and collect artifacts as he visited them on his leaves. He was dedicated to learning native life traditions, like Chilkat weaving, bear hunting, feuds, and the potlatch (a very big ceremonial feast). He was able to understand beliefs and values and recorded, through his ethnographer's devotion, also the Tlingit terms. He was assigned from 1891&ndash;1893 to the World's Columbian Exposition to accompany the Alaskan exhibit. Emmons retired in 1899 and took on special projects for the federal government. He was sent to Alaska in 1901 to locate border stone markers between Canada and the USA. He gave advice in 1902 about Alaskan game and forests and salmon fishery. In 1904, he gathered information about white settlers and Alaska Natives and asked President Theodore Roosevelt to investigate in Alaska Native conditions, because of starvation among the Copper River Indians. He was supported by Roosevelt and presented in 1905 a report to the Congress. His interests in Alaska Natives got him into close contact with the American Museum of Natural History, which purchased his first two collections of Alaska Native artifacts in the 1890s and with which Emmons had an exchange of items for the next three decades. (In 1902 the Field Museum of Natural History purchased a large and varied collection of more than 1,900 Tlingit objects. ) F. W. Putnam, curator of the American museum, asked for his help on a report in 1896 and repeated the request to the navy the following year. So Emmons was officially ordered and detached from active service to write the Ethnological report on the Native tribes of Southeast Alaska, elaborated from the museum collections. He became a regular contributor to The American Museum Journal (forerunner of Natural History journal) and other scholarly periodicals. At the recommendation of Franz Boas, with whom he corresponded regularly and at the request of the president of the American Museum of Natural History, Morris K. Jesup, he began to organize his notes and prepare a manuscript on the Tlingit. When he died in Victoria, British Columbia in 1945, the encyclopedic book was still unfinished. The work was taken over by Frederica de Laguna in 1955 and finally published 1991 with the title The Tlingit Indians. It includes topics such as census data, names of clans and houses, species of plants and their uses, native calendars, and names of gambling sticks.

They are evergreen shrubs or small trees present in the chaparral biome of western North America, where they occur from southern British Columbia,Washington to California and New Mexico in the United States, and throughout much of northern and central Mexico. They are characterized by smooth, orange or red bark and stiff, twisting branches.

Erysimum franciscanum, commonly known as the Franciscan Wallflower or San Francisco Wallflower, is a plant endemic to the northern California coast, from Sonoma to Santa Cruz County. It is a member of the wallflower genus in the mustard family, the Brassicaceae. The plant is a biennial or short-lived perennial. The flowers are cream-colored, with four sepals and four petals arranged in a cross shape, as is characteristic of the Brassicaceae. It is usually reported to flower from February to April, but can be seen in flower as early as January and as late as June, depending on the site. The plant is delicate-looking; it prefers open scrubby areas with a fair amount of sunlight, but can flourish on a range of soils including disintegrating serpentine, gravelly and sandy soils. It is fairly easily cultivated in gardens. Although not formally recognised as endangered, the Franciscan wallflower has a limited, discontinuous distribution, and its numbers are kept under observation by the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department (since some of its last known habitats in the city area are in parks) and the California Native Plant Society.

Lupinus arboreus (Yellow Bush Lupine) is a species of lupine native to the western United States in California, where it is widely distributed coastal scrub and sand dunes. Because it has been widely introduced, there is some uncertainty about its native range; it is thought to be native from Point Reyes National Seashore south to San Luis Obispo County. It is a perennial shrub growing to 2 m tall (hence the alternative common name, tree lupine) in sheltered situations, but more typically 1-1.5 m tall. It has green to gray-green palmate leaves, with 5-12 leaflets per leaf. The leaflets are 2-6 cm long, often sparsely covered with fine silky hairs. Both yellow and lilac to purple flowering forms are known; however, the yellow form is more common, except in the north of the species' range. It is capable of tolerating temperatures down to -12\u00B0C and living for up to seven years.

Hugh Loebner (born March 26, 1942) is notable as the sponsor of the Loebner Prize, an embodiment of the Turing test. He is an American inventor, holding six United States Patents. He is also an outspoken social activist for the decriminalization of prostitution. Loebner established the Loebner Prize in 1990. He pledged to give $100,000 and a solid gold medal to the first programmer able to write a program whose communicative behavior can fool humans into thinking that the program is human. The competition is repeated annually and has been hosted by various organizations. Within the field of artificial intelligence, the Loebner Prize is somewhat controversial; the most prominent critic, Marvin Minsky, has called it a publicity stunt that does not help the field along. Loebner has been quite open about his visits to prostitutes. In 1994, after a campaign by officials in New York City to arrest customers of prostitutes, he wrote an opposing letter to The New York Times, and it was published. In 1996 he authored a Magna Carta for Sex Work or Manifesto of Sexual Freedom, in which he denounced the criminalization of consensual sexual acts, and asked all like minded people to join a protest on 6/9/96 (a play on the 69 sex position). In interviews he has said that he believes to be too old for the young attractive women he is interested in; they would not have sex with him were it not for the money. He has compared the oppression of prostitutes and their customers to the oppression that Alan Turing faced because of his homosexual behavior. Loebner also likes to point out that, unlike the solid gold medal for the Loebner prize, the gold medals of the Olympic Games are not solid gold, but are made of silver covered with a thin layer of gold. Loebner holds a Ph.D. in demography from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He is divorced, lives in New York City and owns Crown Industries, a manufacturer of crowd control stanchion and brass fittings, which is the major sponsor of the Loebner Prize in the US. Fascinated by Alan Turing's imitation game, and considering creating a system himself to pass it, Loebner realised that even if he were to succeed in developing a computer that could pass the Turing test, no avenue existed in which to prove it. In his letter of December 30, 1988 to Dr. Robert Epstein, Loebner authorized Dr. Epstein to move forward with a contest, and referring to the Turing Test, Loebner wrote: \"Robert, in years to come, there may be richer prizes, and more prestigious contests, but gads, this will always be the oldest. \" Establishing the Loebner Prize, he introduced the Turing Test to a wider public, and stimulated interest in this science. It remains Hugh Loebner\u2019s desire to advance AI, and for the Turing Test to serve as a tool to measure the state of the art: \"There is a nobility in this endeavour. If we humans can succeed in developing an artificial intellect it will be a measure of the scope of our intellect\" .

Durbin made her first film appearance in 1936 with Judy Garland in Every Sunday, and subsequently signed a contract with Universal Studios. Her success as the ideal teenage daughter in films such as Three Smart Girls (1936) was credited with saving the studio from bankruptcy and in 1938, Durbin was awarded the Academy Juvenile Award. While her fans remained faithful as she entered adulthood, Durbin would grow dissatisfied with the girl-next-door roles assigned to her, so she attempted to portray a more mature and sophisticated style, but the film noir Christmas Holiday (1944) and the whodunit Lady on a Train (1945) were not as well received as her musical comedies and romances. Her dissatisfaction with Hollywood led to her early departure from the limelight and her retirement from acting and singing in 1949. Durbin married film producer-director Charles Henri David in 1950 and following her marriage moved to a farmhouse in the outskirts of Paris. Since then she has withdrawn from public life.

Angelina Helen Catherine Cordovano (June 28, 1925 - November 22, 1988), known professionally as Cathy Carr, was a pop singer. She was born in the New York borough of The Bronx. As a child, she appeared on The Children's Hour, a television show locally aired in New York, sponsored by Horn &amp; Hardart, a cafeteria chain which had locations in New York and Philadelphia. She later became a singer and dancer with the USO and joined big band orchestras such as those of Sammy Kaye, Johnny Dee, and Larry Fontaine. In 1953 she signed with Coral Records, but had no hits for them, later switching to Fraternity Records, a small company based in Cincinnati, Ohio, in early 1955. It was for Fraternity that she had her only major hit, \"Ivory Tower\", which was her third record for Fraternity. She never again had another big hit, though in 1959 she had two small successes for Roulette Records. She recorded one single for Smash Records in 1961, which was a more mature song, but went back to recording teenage pop on Laurie Records in 1962. She moved to RCA to record a number of albums of standards, before Laurie released her final single in 1967. Her first LP was reissued on Dot Records in 1966. In spite of her age, at the time of her 1956 hit Carr recorded a lot of high school pop, not moving on to more mature songs and standards until her pop career was all but over. The CD age saw an unofficial release of selected singles which showed her preference to seem younger than she was and did not include any of her attempts at more mature songs.
Albert Hoffman (1915 - 1993) was an American painter and wood carver. Never progressing beyond a sixth-grade education, Hoffman earned his living operating a junkyard in Galloway Township, near Atlantic City, New Jersey. A self-taught artist, he found inspiration in narratives from the Torah and Nevi'im; over his lifetime he produced over 250 carvings whose subjects were drawn from the Bible or from his Jewish background. His works are also a mirror of his personal interests: whaling, horse racing, and Native Americans all found places in his paintings. He produced three different types of carvings, bas reliefs, columnar reliefs, and compositional groups. Though he sold some of his works, and also did some carving for local synagogues, he created most of his art for himself. Nonetheless, he exhibited his work locally, where it won top prizes. His work has been shown across the eastern United States and a number of American museums hold public collections, including the American Folk Art Museum, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum, and the Noyes Museum of Art.

Conium is a genus of two species of highly poisonous perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, native to Europe and the Mediterranean region (C. maculatum), and to southern Africa (C. chaerophylloides). By far the most familiar species is Conium maculatum (Hemlock or Poison Hemlock). It is a herbaceous biennial plant which grows between 1.5\u20132.5 metres (5\u20138 ft) tall, with a smooth green stem, usually spotted or streaked with red or purple on the lower half of the stem. The leaves are finely divided and lacy, overall triangular in shape, up to 50 centimetres (20 in) long and 40 centimetres (16 in) broad. The flowers are small, white, clustered in umbels up to 10\u201315 centimetres (4\u20136 in) across. When crushed, the leaves and root emit a rank, unpleasant odour sometimes compared to that of parsnips or mice.

He graduated from Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, in 1860; the following year he married Emma M. Bulkeley, of Orange, New Jersey; they had five children. Cady was a devoted Presbyterian, who served as head of the Sunday school at the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, East 42nd Street; his first church commission was the First Presbyterian Church of Oyster Bay, New York. Here he utilized the Carpenter Gothic or Stick Style to create a surprising effect for this wood-frame church building set on a hillside overlooking Oyster Bay.

The New Americans is a seven-hour American documentary that was originally broadcast on American television over three nights on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in late March 2004. The observational documentary, which includes minimal voice-over narration and very little direct interviewing of its subjects (and none in which the interviewer's voice is heard), follows the lives of a series of immigrants to the United States over the course of four years. The series was filmed between 1998 and 2001, although not all of its subjects were filmed during that entire length of time. The immigrants were filmed both in their countries of origin before immigrating as well as in the United States. The filming during this period was extensive and occurred in the subjects' homes, at their places of work, in government offices, and in a number of other situations, many of them quite intimate. As a result, The New Americans offers an unusually personal and comprehensive look at the people it profiles. The immigrants profiled and filmed in The New Americans include a group of baseball players from the Dominican Republic hoping to secure a career in Major League Baseball; a computer programmer from India and his wife; a family with six children from a farming community in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico; a family of Ogoni refugees from Nigeria; and a woman from Palestine who moves to the United States to be with her new husband, a first-generation Palestinian-American who grew up in Chicago. The locations shown in the documentary include not only each of the immigrants' countries of origin, but also many places in the United States where the immigrants settled or traveled, including Chicago (the Palestinian and Nigerian immigrants), the Silicon Valley of California (the Indian immigrants), Garden City, Kansas and Mecca, California (the Mexican immigrants), and Florida, Georgia and Montana (the Dominican immigrants). The New Americans was executive produced by Steve James (who also produced the acclaimed 1994 documentary Hoop Dreams) and Gordon Quinn, both of Kartemquin Films. It was broadcast on PBS as part of the series Independent Lens, in association with the Independent Television Service (ITVS). The program was broadcast in the United Kingdom on the cable network BBC Four in early April 2004. \"New Americans\" is also a generic term used to describe immigrants to the United States, although this term is used less often than its counterpart term in Australia, where \"New Australians\" is a relatively common phrase.
Shannon (born Brenda Shannon Greene, May 2, 1958) is an American singer. She is best known for her 1983 million-selling record, \"Let the Music Play\". The record re-defined the electro funk sound that Arthur Baker and John Rocca (who produced \"I.O. U\" by Freeez) developed in 1982, which would eventually be called freestyle music.
Nemophila is a genus found in the flowering plant family Hydrophyllaceae. Most of the species in Nemophila contain the phrase \"baby blue-eyes\" in their common names. N. menziesii has the common name of \"Baby blue-eyes\". N. parviflora is called the \"Smallflower baby blue-eyes\" and N. spatulata is called the \"Sierra baby blue-eyes\". An exception to this naming tendency is N. maculata, whose common name is Fivespot. Nemophila species are mainly native to the western United States, though some species are also found in western Canada and Mexico, and in the southeastern United States. Nemophila are commonly offered for sale for garden cultivation. Generally these are N. menziesii.

H. Craig Severance (1879 \u2013 2 September 1941) was an American architect who designed a number of well-known buildings in New York City, including the Coca-Cola Building, Nelson Tower and most prominently, 40 Wall Street. In his early career, Severance worked for Carrere and Hastings and later, in partnership with William Van Alen. The partnership ended on unfriendly terms, and in the late 1920s, the two found themselves in competition to build the world's tallest building, with Severance's 40 Wall Street and Van Alen's, Chrysler Building. Although the Chrysler Building claimed victory with its spire at 1,046 feet, Severance protested that his building had the highest usuable space. The issue became moot when the Empire State Building was completed less than a year later.
The Pipestem Clematis (Clematis lasiantha) is a creamy-white flowering liana, belonging to subgenus Clematis of the large Clematis genus. It is found on the Pacific coast of North America, from the San Francisco Bay Area southwards into Baja California. It extends as far east as the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, but does not grow in the Central Valley, nor at heights greater than about 2000 metres. It grows on hillsides, in chaparral, and in open woodland. The Pipestem Clematis flowers from January to June. Its leaves are 3-lobed, and generally grow groups of three to five leaflets, the largest leaves on the plant normally being between 3 and 5 cm in size. The Pipestem Clematis can be distinguished from the similar (but much more widely ranging) Virgin's Bower (Clematis ligusticifolia) by the fact that Pipestems normally only have one flower on each stalk, and at most three, whereas the Virgin's Bower has multiple flowers on each stem. The Pipestem also has more pistils in each flower, but since both species have many, this is not an easy criterion to apply. The Virgin's Bower is more likely to be found along streams or in other wet places, whereas the Pipestem tolerates more open, drier places.
The year 1960 in architecture involved some significant events.
Collinsia heterophylla is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California. It is known as Purple Chinese Houses or Innocence. Like the other species in the genus Collinsia, which also includes the Blue-eyed Marys, it gets its name from its towers of inflorescences, of decreasing diameter, which give the plants in full flower a certain resemblance to a pagoda. Purple Chinese Houses is an annual plant growing in shady places, and can be found in most of California, other than desert regions, below about 1000 metres. It blooms from mid spring to early summer. The plant is from 10-50 cm tall. Dried in air, the seeds weigh about 1 mg each. The species was first described as Collinsia bicolor by George Bentham in 1835, but this name proved to be a later homonym of Collinsia bicolor Raf. (described in 1824) necessitating the name change to C. heterophylla. Despite this, the name C. bicolor is still sometimes used for this species.

Carole Bayer Sager is an American lyricist, songwriter and singer.
Walter Jeremiah Sanders III (born September 12, 1936) was a co-founder and a long-time CEO of the American semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Jerry Sanders III grew up in the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, raised by his paternal grandparents. He was once attacked and beaten by a street gang, leaving him so covered in blood that a priest was called to administer the last rites, but Jerry recovered. He attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on an academic scholarship from the Pullman railroad car company. He graduated with his bachelor's degree in engineering in 1958. After graduation he went to work for the Douglas Aircraft Company. He eventually moved to Motorola, then to Fairchild Semiconductor. He became known as one of Fairchild's best sales people in the 1960s and was famous for his style and flair. In 1968 Sherman Fairchild brought a new management team into Fairchild Semiconductor, led by C. Lester Hogan, then vice president of Motorola Semiconductor. The troops from Motorola, also known as \"Hogan's Heroes\", were notoriously conservative, and immediately clashed with Sanders' boisterous style. He was one of the architects of Silicon Valley. In 1969 a group of Fairchild engineers decided to start a new company, which became Advanced Micro Devices. They asked Jerry Sanders to join them, and he said he would, provided he became the president of the company. Although it caused some dissension within the group, they agreed, and the company was founded with Sanders as President. Sanders took his trademark style into his position as the CEO of AMD. He remained the company's consummate salesperson, always available to come in on the really tough negotiations and close them. He loved visiting the Los Angeles sales office on Wilshire Blvd near Hollywood and staying at the Beverly Hills Hilton. Sanders always wanted to make money, but he realized that the key to earning wealth was for everyone else at AMD to make a lot of money too. While growing wealthy, he also lavished wealth generously on all his employees. At the end of the company's first $1 million quarter, Sanders stood by the door of the company and handed a $100 bill to every employee as they left. Every employee at the company got stock options, a huge innovation at the time. Sanders gave the company a strong sales and marketing orientation, so that it was successful even though it was often a little behind its competitors in technology and manufacturing. He shared the success of the company with the employees, usually coincident with sales-oriented growth targets. One time, as a successful sales goal was met, the company held a drawing among all the employees, and an immigrant production worker in Sunnyvale, California won $1000 a month for 20 years (USD 240,000). He drove the company through hard times as well. In 1974, a particularly bad recession almost broke the company, but a brilliant sales deal worked out by Sanders with one of the company's distributors saved the company. Through many difficult recessions he refused to lay off employees, a reaction to the rampant layoffs that had occurred at Fairchild earlier. Instead of cutting employees, he asked them to work Saturdays to get more done and get new products out sooner. In 1982, he was responsible for a licensing deal with Intel that made AMD a second source to IBM for the Intel Microprocessor series, a deal that eventually made the company the only real competitor to Intel. In 2000, Sanders recruited H\u00E9ctor Ruiz, at the time the president of Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector, to serve as AMD's president and chief operating officer, and to become heir apparent to lead the company upon Sanders' retirement. Ruiz succeeded Sanders in the CEO's seat in 2002. Jerry Sanders has four children (three from his first marriage and one from his second), three who are now adults and one who is currently living with him and his wife, Tawny, and his daughter Paris. Sanders created Advanced Micro Devices; his personality was the company's personality &mdash; colorful, brash,and extremely innovative. His maxim was: \"people first, products and profit will follow!\" This was given as a printout for each AMD worker who started a job at AMD in Dresden/Germany until Jerry Sanders retirement.

The manroots, wild cucumbers, or cucumber gourd are flowering plants in the gourd family, native to western North America. They are also commonly called Old man in the ground. The genus name comes from Hebrew \u05DE\u05B8\u05E8\u05B8\u0594\u05D0, and was given because all parts of these plants tend to have a bitter taste. Except for the isolated range of the Gila Manroot (M. gilensis) in west-central Arizona and island populations (M. macrocarpus var. major), all manroot species inhabit overlapping ranges distributed from Southern Canada to Northern Mexico. Although Coastal Manroot (M. oreganus) extends inland into Idaho, all other manroot species except M. gilensis are confined to areas within 300km of the Pacific Ocean coast.

A fiddleneck is a flowering plant in the genus Amsinckia. The name derives from the flower stems, bearing many small flowers, which curl over at the top in a manner reminiscent of the head of a fiddle. Fiddlenecks are in the family Boraginaceae, along with borage and forget-me-nots. The fiddlenecks are native to western North America and south-western South America, but they have spread widely to other regions. They are annuals, many of them bristly. Most have an erect stem, whose height varies from 20 to 120 cm. In most species the flowers are yellow, often with an orange tinge. Most are found at relatively low altitudes, below 500 metres. The seeds and foliage of fiddlenecks are poisonous to livestock, particularly cattle, because they contain alkaloids and high concentrations of nitrates. The sharp hairs of the plants can cause skin irritation in humans. However, the shoots, seeds or leaves of several species were used as food by Native Americans, and the plant also had some medicinal uses. The species are hard to distinguish, and their ranges overlap; furthermore several of them have large numbers of slightly different varieties, and several of the species hybridise naturally. To decide which species a particular specimen belongs to, therefore, is likely to require a detailed examination with an identification key in hand.
Matthew Lyon (July 14, 1749 \u2013 August 1, 1822), father of Chittenden Lyon and great-grandfather of William Peters Hepburn, was a printer, farmer, soldier and politician, serving as a United States Representative from Vermont and from Kentucky. Lyon was born near Dublin, in near by County Wicklow, Ireland, and attended school in Dublin. He began to learn the trade of printer in 1763 and immigrated to Connecticut in 1765. Lyon was landed as a redemptioner and worked on a farm in Woodbury, where he continued his education. Lyon moved to Wallingford, Vermont (then known as the New Hampshire Grants), in 1774 and organized a company of militia. He served as adjutant in Colonel Seth Warner's regiment in Canada in 1775, and was then commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the regiment known as the Green Mountain Boys in July 1776. He moved to Arlington, Vermont, in 1777. Lyon resigned from the Army in 1778 and became a member of the Vermont House of Representatives from 1779-1783. He founded the town of Fair Haven, Vermont in 1779 and returned to the state House of Representatives for ten years during the period 1783-1796. He built and operated various kinds of mills, including one for the manufacture of paper, established a printing office in 1793 and published the Farmers' Library, afterward the Fair Haven Gazette. Lyon was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the Second and Third Congresses, and unsuccessfully contested the election of Israel Smith to the Fourth Congress. He was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Fifth and Sixth Congresses (March 4, 1797 - March 3, 1801); he was not a candidate for renomination in 1800. Lyon had the distinction of being the first member to have an ethics violation charge filed against him when he was accused of \"gross indecency\" for spitting on Roger Griswold of Connecticut after an exchange of insults on January 30, 1798; although the Ethics Committee recommended censure, the House as a whole rejected the motion to censure him. Lyon also has the distinction of being the only person to be elected to Congress while in jail. In 1798, Lyon was found guilty of violating the Alien and Sedition Acts, which prohibited malicious writing of the American government or its officials. Lyon was the first person to be put to trial for violating the acts on charges of criticizing Federalist president John Adams and disagreeing with Adams' decision to go to war against France. Lyon was sentenced to four months in jail and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and court costs. While in jail, Lyon won election to the Sixth Congress. In the election of 1800 Matthew Lyon cast the deciding vote for Jefferson after the election went to the House of Representatives because of an electoral tie. Lyon moved to Kentucky in 1801 and settled in Caldwell County. He became a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1802 and was elected to the Eighth and to the three succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1803 - March 3, 1811). He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1810 to the Twelfth Congress. Lyon was appointed United States factor to the Cherokee Nation in Arkansas Territory in 1820; and again attempted to serve in Washington, DC when he unsuccessfully contested the election of James W. Bates as a Delegate from Arkansas Territory to the Seventeenth Congress. Lyon died in Spadra Bluff, Arkansas, August 1, 1822; interment in Spadra Bluff Cemetery; reinterment in Eddyville Cemetery, Eddyville, Caldwell (now Lyon) County, Ky. , in 1833.

Henry Ries (September 22, 1917 - May 24, 2004) was a photographer who worked for the New York Times. His most famous photo was of \"The Berlin Air Lift\" which was later made into a U.S. Postage Stamp commemorative. Ries was born in Berlin and grew up in Germany, but sensed the impending doom of Hitler's political style and, as a Jew, emigrated to the United States in 1937. Immigration officials in New York sent him back to Nazi Germany because of technical problems with his papers. Fortunately, Ries was permitted to enter America in January 1938, having crossed the Atlantic twice to do so. When America entered World War II, Ries immediately joined the army and fought in the Asian Theater, humorously pointing out that he served in Asia due to his \"good German\" skills. He was stationed in India with an aerial reconnaissance unit. After the war, in August 1945, Ries, still a soldier, returned to Berlin. He soon resigned from the army in order to work for the OMGUS Observer as a photojournalist. Two years later, he begin to work for the The New York Times as a European photographer, photographing many of the scenes of destroyed post-war Germany including the destruction and Berlin blockade which have become iconic images. In 1951, Ries returned to the US and eventually turned to commercial photography. In 1955, he opened his own studio in Manhattan. When he returned to Berlin in 1945, he pronounced the city forever changed. In his book, Abschied meiner Generation, he said, \"Seeing all this devastation and desperation, confronted with hunger and fear, cripples and black-marketers -- and with no Nazi in sight anywhere -- I realized how fundamentally the seven years between emigration and occupation had changed Germany's exterior and my own interior. \" During his time with the Times, he met and photographed the famous and the infamous, such as artists Pablo Picasso and Pablo Casals, as well as Spanish dictator Generalissimo Francisco Franco. In 2003 he was awarded Germany's Officer Cross of the Order of Merit, the highest award for citizens of other countries.

Following that band's demise, he went on to sing for Hands Tied and Face the Enemy, and has been with Triple Threat since 2004. according to Tim: Here's an extremely condensed version. I started skateboarding in 1985. Late 1985, early 1986 I discovered punk / hardcore. June 27, 1987 I went to my first show, Descendents, Rollins Band and MIA at City Gardens, soon after followed by Dag Nasty and Agent Orange at City Gardens. Late 1987, early 1988 introduced me to straight edge hardcore. Some of my earliest memories involving straight edge hardcore shows focus around live sets by bands like: Bold, Insted, Judge, Gorilla Biscuits, Chain Of Strength and Turning Point. In 1988 I started a fanzine called Slew, that lasted three issues. Late 1988 I started Common Sense Fanzine with my friend Tony. By late 1989, early 1990 I started a hardcore band. Originally known as Control, we played about two shows under that name, then changed our name to Mouthpiece. Mouthpiece existed from 1990 to 1996. In that time period we released two 7\"s and one full length, all on New Age Records. Mouthpiece played the east coast consistently, occasionally played the mid west and quite a few times played the west coast. We toured in 1995 and broke up in 1996. 1996 brought forth a new band, Hands Tied. Hands Tied recorded a record for Equal Vision Records, played the east coast here and there, then toured Europe in 1998. Hands Tied broke up in 1999. From 1999 to 2001 I remained bandless. Aside from a small group of Mouthpiece reunion shows in 2000, I didn't find myself getting involved with a new band until 2001. 2001 brought me into the position of working on a project with an old friend, Ken Olden from DC. We called the band Face The Enemy, recorded a full length album and a 7\". Face The Enemy played a small handful of shows, did a short tour with Impact (now Stand &amp; Fight), then took the back seat to our personal lives. In 2002 I got married to my long time girlfriend and all around best friend, Traci. May 2003 brought forth the birth of our first child, Trevor Jordan McMahon. By 2004, I started a new band, Triple Threat. This brings us to the present. Triple Threat played our first show in June 2004 with Insted. We recorded for a 5 song 7\" on Livewire Records, which was released in November 2005. Following the release of the 7\", we played a string of shows up and down the East Coast. In March 2006, Triple Threat recorded a 13 song full length album for Bridge 9 Records called \"Into The Darkness\". July 25, 2006, \"Into The Darkness\" was released, followed by shows on the Warped Tour, the GB reunion, the 2006 This Is Hardcore fest and the infamous CBGB's. Triple Threat will continue to play out as much as possible and plan on recording a future EP. Aside from Triple Threat, most of my time goes to my family, my work (graphic design) and my hobbies (Apple Computers, following sports, horror movies, Volkswagens etc...). February 2007 brought forth the birth of one more little McMahon, this time a girl, Taryn.

Willis Alan Ramsey (born 1951) is an American singer/songwriter, a cult legend among fans of Americana and Texas country. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama and raised in Dallas, Texas. Ramsey graduated from Highland Park High School in 1969, and was a prominent baritone in the High School's Lads and Lassies Choir. He played a leading role in the musical Carousel, his senior year. In 1972, he released his album, Willis Alan Ramsey, on the Shelter label. This album received a large amount of critical acclaim. The album included \"Muskrat Candlelight\" which was covered twice in short order, first by America in 1973, then by Captain &amp; Tennille, who scored a #4 hit with the tune. Windham Hill's Michael Hedges has cited Ramsey as a strong influence on his left-handed tapping techniques. In a radio interview, Hedges claims he developed the technique listening to Ramsey's album, then saying that Ramsey had no idea \"how I got it from him, so I guess I'm safe. \" Owing to conflict with his label, Ramsey left Shelter at the end of his contract. This circumstance resulted in Ramsey's fans waiting more than 35 years for the release of Ramsey's \"mythical second album\". In the 1980s, he moved to Great Britain to reconnect with his ancestry and study traditional and modern music narrative. At the same time, he enjoyed a revival in the United States, due in part to numerous artists who cut versions of Ramsey's songs, including Jerry Jeff Walker (\"Northeast Texas Women\"), Waylon Jennings, Shawn Colvin (\"Satin Sheets\"), Jimmy Buffett (\"The Ballad of Spider John,\" \"Northeast Texas Women\"), and Jimmie Dale Gilmore (\"Goodbye to Old Missoula\"). In 1989, he returned to the United States and began performing again. Backed by Champ Hood, multi-instrumentalist (of Uncle Walt's Band fame), Ramsey could often be found on the same bill with another Dallas singer-songwriter, Alison Rogers. The two married in 1991 and continue to perform together. In 1996, Ramsey and Rogers co-wrote Lyle Lovett's hit, \"That's Right, You're Not From Texas\". In 2000, Ramsey appeared on Austin City Limits, showcasing his new material, along with his many older classics.

Joseph James Kelley (December 9, 1871 &ndash; August 14, 1943) was an American left fielder in Major League Baseball who starred in the outfield of the powerful Baltimore Oriole teams of the 1890s. Kelley broke into the National League in 1891 with the Boston Beaneaters, and after a brief stint in Pittsburgh the following year, came into his own as a member of the Baltimore Orioles in 1893. In 1894 he had arguably his finest offensive season, batting .393 with 111 RBI and 165 runs. Combined with 107 walks, Kelley posted a spectacular .502 on base percentage. Kelley continued his fine hitting throughout his career, which included stops with the Brooklyn Superbas (1899&ndash;1901), the fledgling American League's Baltimore Orioles franchise (1902), the Cincinnati Reds (1902 - 1906), and Boston again (1908). Aside from consistent run production and hitting (which included 11 consecutive .300-plus seasons), Kelley was also known as a good base runner and stole a career-high 87 bases in 1896. He retired with a career .317 batting, .402 on base percentage, 65 home runs (including a career high 10 in 1895), 1421 runs, 1194 RBI and 443 stolen bases in 1853 career games. Kelley also managed from 1902 until 1905 with the Cincinnati Reds, and in 1908 with the Boston Doves. He compiled a solid, but unspectacular, 338-321 record as a major league manager. Kelley managed the Toronto Maple Leafs to the International League pennant in 1907, and returned to manage the team from 1909 to 1914, winning a second pennant in 1912. Kelley was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.
For other people with this name, see Frank Howard. Frank J. Howard (March 25, 1909 \u2013 January 26, 1996) was an American college football player and coach. He played college football for Alabama and was a teammate of legendary coach Bear Bryant. After a career-ending injury, Howard joined the staff at Clemson College and became head coach in 1939. Howard would coach the Clemson Tigers for 30 years, amassing the 15th most wins of any college football coach. He led Clemson to ten bowl games, an undefeated season in 1949, and several Top-20 rankings during his tenure as head coach. During his stay at Clemson, Howard also oversaw the athletic department, ticket sales, and was an assistant coach for the baseball team. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, the South Carolina Sports Hall of Fame, and the Clemson Ring of Honor. The playing surface at Clemson's Memorial Stadium is named after him. Howard was born at Barlow Bend, Alabama (\"three wagon greasin's from Mobile\"). He spent his early days on the farm playing mostly cow pasture baseball because there were not enough boys around the community for a football team. Howard said he left Barlow Bend walking barefoot on a barbed wire fence with a wildcat under each arm. He graduated from Murphy High School in Mobile where he played football, baseball and basketball and served as president of both the junior and senior classes. After finishing at Murphy, Howard entered the University of Alabama on an academic scholarship provided by the Birmingham News in the fall of 1927, and the 185-pounder played reserve guard his sophomore year. During his junior year he started every game but two, as an ankle injury sidelined him for the two games he missed. Again his senior year he was a regular. Howard was president of the freshman class at Alabama, was member of Blue Key and president of the \"A\" Club. Howard stepped onto the rolling hills of Clemson in 1931 fresh from the varsity football ranks at Alabama where he was a first stringer on Wallace Wade's 1930 team that drubbed Washington State 24\u20130 in the 1931 Rose Bowl Howard was known as the \"Little Giant' of the Tide's \"Herd of Red Elephants. \" The bald veteran came to his first coaching post under Jess Neely as a line tutor. \"At least that was my title,\" Howard recalls. \"Actually, I also coached track, was ticket manager, recruited players and had charge of football equipment. In my spare time I cut grass, lined tennis courts and operated the canteen while the regular man was out to lunch:' Howard was not only track coach from 1931\u201339, but served as baseball coach in 1943 and his 12\u20133 record that year is still among the best percent ages for a season in Clemson history. Howard held the line coaching post until Neely went to Rice University as head coach in 1940. When the Clemson Athletic Council met to name a successor to Neely, Prof. Sam Rhodes, a council member, nominated Howard to be the new head coach. Howard, standing in the back of the room listening to the discussion, said; \"I second the nomination. \" He got the job and never left. When he retired as head coach following the 1969 season, he was the nation's dean of coaches, having been a head football coach at a major institution longer than anyone else in the United States. When he retired, he was one of five active coaches with 150 or more victories. While line coach in 1939, the Tigers' record (8\u20131) was good enough to merit a trip to Dallas where Clemson met undefeated Boston College under Frank Leahy in the 1940 Cotton Bowl Classic. The 1948 mark of 10\u20130 carried Clemson to the 1949 Gator Bowl and two years later, a 9\u20130\u20131 record sent the Tigers to Miami's Orange Bowl (1950). The Country Gentlemen were champions on their first three bowl ventures. Boston College fell 6\u20133, Missouri was nipped in the Gator, 24\u201323 (Howard said this is the best football game he ever witnessed), and Miami felt the Tiger claws, 15\u201314. The total point spread in these three bowl wins was five points. The Gator Bowl beckoned the Tigers again in January 1952, and by being conference champions in 1956, Clemson played in the '57 Orange Bowl classic again. Miami downed Clemson 14\u20130 in the second Gator Bowl trip, and Colorado led Clemson 20\u20130, then trailed 21\u201320 before finally defeating the Tigers 27\u201321 in the second Orange Bowl. The Tigers then played in the 1959 Sugar Bowl and held the #1-ranked LSU Tigers to a standstill before losing 7\u20130, leading to an LSU National Championship. The invitation to play in the first Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston in December 1959 was the eighth bowl that Howard had been a part of either as a player, assistant coach or head coach. It was the seventh bowl trip for a Clemson team and the sixth in 12 years. Howard said that Clemson's 23\u20137 triumph over seventh ranked Texas Christian in the Bluebonnet Bowl was the best performance he had ever witnessed by a Clemson team. Clemson was the first school to play in two bowls in the same calendar year. The Tigers' victory over TCU was their fourth success in seven post-season appearances. In all seven Clemson was the established underdog. Howard served on the coaching staff of the Blue-Gray game in Montgomery, Alabama in 1941, 1952, 1959, and 1966; was on the East staff of the annual East-West game in San Francisco in December 1960, and again in December 1962; and was named coach of the South squad in Miami's 196l and 1969 North-South game. He coached in the 1970 Hula Bowl, which was his ninth postseason all-star game. While still in active coaching Howard served as one of the rules committee members for A period of three years. A Single Wing expert for 22 seasons (including nine as a line coach), Howard changed to the T-formation and its many variations in 1953. Still another major change in the offense was installed in 1965 with the \"I\" and pro-type set. In his 13 seasons as head coach using the single wing, Clemson won 69, lost 47 and tied 7. In 12 years of \"T\" teams, the Tigers won 71, lost 47 and tied 4. While using the \"I\" in his last five years of coaching, Clemson recorded a 25\u201324\u20131 record. The year 1958 was a red letter one for Howard. During halftime of the Spring Game, Howard, his staff and secretaries were given an appreciation day. Howard received a 1958 car while other staff members were presented gifts. That summer Howard and three members of his staff were given a trip to Europe by the Department of Defense to conduct clinics for the Armed Forces in Germany. Then came the football season and the Tigers presented Howard an 8\u20132 season, which led to the Sugar Bowl invitation. One of these 1958 wins was the l00th of Howard's coaching career. That came against Jim Tatum of North Carolina, a coach Howard had never beaten. And, the Tigers had to come from behind three times to win, 26\u201321. Howard was named Southern Conference Coach-of-the-Year in 1948. In 1959 he was named Atlantic Coast Conference Coach-of-the-Year and was accorded the honor again in 1966. His teams won ACC championships six times (1956\u201358\u201359\u201365\u201366\u201367) in the first 15 years of the conference. The Tigers were co-champions in 1965. He guided Clemson to the Southern Conference crown in 1940 and 1948. In his 30 years of coaching, Howard won 165, lost 118 and tied 12. That victory total is still among the top 40 coaches in the history of the game. In addition to heading up the Clemson football program Howard also had the job of directing Clemson's entire athletic program, and at the same time raising all the required scholarship funds. The athletic department was always on a sound financial footing under the guidance of Howard. Howard retired from coaching on December 10, 1969, after 39 years on the Clemson coaching staff, 30 of which were as head coach. He was also athletic director during this time and he kept this position until February 4, 1971, when he was named assistant to the vice president at the university, the post he held when the mandatory retirement age of 65 rolled around. An era at Clemson University ended June 30, 1974, when Frank Howard officially retired from the payroll. Another era ended January 26, 1996, when Howard died at the age of 86 and forever silenced a voice that had been synonymous with Clemson for nearly 65 years. He was the school's best known ambassador. Although he retired from all official duties in 1974, he never quit coming to the office and he never stopped representing Clemson in a manner which continued to win friends for the place that was so dear to his heart. Shortly after his retirement the Clemson Board of Trustees named the playing surface of Memorial Stadium as \"Frank Howard Field\" in honor of his long service to the university. It was only the third time that a building or installation had been named by the trustees for a living person. Over the years, Howard has been inducted into the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame and the Clemson Hall of Fame (charter member in both), as well as the Helms Athletic Hall of Fame and the State of Alabama Hall of Fame. On December 5, 1989 he joined an elite group in the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame. The ceremonies took place in the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. He joined former Clemson mentors John Heisman and Jess Neely in the membership. Howard was also honored in December 1981, when he was inducted into the Orange Bowl Hall of Honor along with former Alabama coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, and Tommy McDonald, a former Oklahoma star. In the summer of 1990 he was inducted into the Gator Bowl Hall of Fame. For over three decades Howard was in great demand both as a banquet speaker and a clinic lecturer. Few states escaped his homespun oratory, which brought the house down on many occasions. After his retirement, Howard was active in other endeavors. He served as state chairman of the South Carolina Heart Fund drive, was roasted several times on behalf of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and was active in selling the Kickoff Publication out of Knoxville, TN. Howard kept his hands in football as he served as the chief recruiter for the Gray squad in the annual Blue-Gray game in Montgomery, Alabama. The Blue squad recruiter was Don Faurot, who opposed Howard in the 1949 Gator Bowl. Howard has also been inducted into the Helms Foundation Hall of Fame in San Francisco, was an honorary member of the National Athletic Trainers Association, and is a member of the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics. Clemson University has also honored Howard once more with the presentation of the Clemson Medallion, which is the highest public honor bestowed by the university to a living person who exemplifies the dedication and foresight of its founders. He was a charter member of Clemson's Ring of Honor at Memorial Stadium in 1994. After coming to Clemson, Howard married the former Anna Tribble of Anderson, South Carolina (who died May 15, 1996) on August 23, 1933. They were the parents of a daughter, Alice (Mrs. Robert McClure of Gastonia, North Carolina) and a son, Jimmy, of Pendleton. The Howards also had three grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Jimmy followed in his dad's footsteps as a football player, only at a different position. The son was regular fullback on the local high school (Daniel) team for three years and was a halfback-fullback for three years on the Clemson varsity. Jimmy gained over 1,400 yards his senior year in high school and scored over 100 points. He graduated from Clemson in June 1964 with honors, and earned his masters degree in horticulture from Clemson in 1967. Today he is district entomologist with the Plant Pest Regulatory Service at Clemson.

Toxicodendron diversilobum (syn. Rhus diversiloba; Western Poison-oak or Pacific Poison-oak) is a plant best known for its ability to cause allergic rashes after contact. Western Poison-oak is found only on the Pacific Coast of the United States and of Canada. It is extremely common in that region, where it is the predominant species of the genus; the closely related Atlantic Poison-oak (T. pubescens) occurs on the Atlantic Coast. The hyphenated form \"Poison-oak\" is used, rather than \"Poison Oak\" to clearly indicate that it is not a variety of oak, just as \"Poison-ivy\" is not a variety of ivy.

John Haberle (1856-1933) was a 19th century American painter in the trompe l'oeil (literally, \"fool the eye\") style. His still lifes of ordinary objects are painted in such a way that the painting can be mistaken for the objects themselves. He is considered one of the three major figures\u2014together with William Harnett and John F. Peto\u2014practicing this form of still life painting in the United States in the last quarter of the 19th century. Haberle was born in New Haven, Connecticut; his parents were Swiss immigrants. At the age of 14 he left school to apprentice with an engraver. He also worked for many years as an exhibit preparator for the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University. His career as a painter began in 1887. His style is characterized by a meticulous rendering of two-dimensional objects. He is especially noted for his depictions of paper objects, including currency. Art historian Alfred Frankenstein has contrasted Haberle's work with that of his contemporaries:Peto is moved by the pathos of used-up things. Haberle is wry and wacky, full of bravado, self-congratulating virtuosity, and sly flamboyance. He works largely within an old tradition, that of the trompe l'oeil still life in painted line ... It is poles away from Harnett's sumptuosity, careful balances, and well-modeled volumes, and is equally far from Peto's sensitivity in matters of tone and hue. A Bachelor's Drawer (1890-94) is typical of his approach: various papers, including currency, postage stamps, photos, playing cards, tickets, and newspaper clippings, are shown affixed to an essentially planar surface. Other objects\u2014eyeglasses, a comb, a pipe, matches, and so on\u2014are shallow enough in volume so as not to spoil the illusion. Like Harnett, he was warned by the Secret Service to cease and desist painting paper money, but he continued to do so throughout his years of greatest productivity; examples include The Changes of Time (1888) and Can You Break a Five? (c. 1885). He painted other subjects such as Slate (c. 1895), a bin of peanuts in Fresh Roasted (1887), The Clay Pipe (1889), and the huge Grandma's Hearthstone (1890), in the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts. By the turn of the century, problems with his eyes diminished Haberle's activity as an artist. Among his later works are paintings of flowers executed in a looser style, and in 1909 he painted his final trompe l'oeil, the large Night, in the collection of the New Britain Museum of American Art, New Britain, Connecticut. Haberle died in 1933.

Aquilegia formosa, sometimes called Crimson Columbine, Western Columbine or (ambiguously) \"Red Columbine\", is a common and attractive wildflower native to western North America, from Alaska to Baja California, and eastward to Montana and Wyoming. It is very often known as the \"Red Columbine\", but because this name is also used for a number of other members of the genus Aquilegia, it is not recommended. Within its range, the Crimson Columbine can be found in most kinds of habitat. It is not found on desert floors, nor at altitudes above 3300 metres, and it is absent from the Central Valley of California. It prefers moist locations such as stream banks. The plant grows to 20-80 cm in height, averaging around 60 cm. Flowers, which can be seen from April to August (with some variation between regions), are about 5 cm long and red and yellow in color. Technically, the red or orange spreading outer parts of the flower are sepals, and the yellow inner parts are the true petals. The petals bear spurs that attract the plant's pollinators, the sphinx moths. The flowers are edible, with a sweet taste\u2014though the seeds can be fatal if eaten, and most parts of the plant contain cyanogenic glycosides.

The Soap Plants, Soaproots or Amoles are the genus Chlorogalum of flowering plants. Less common names for them include Soap Lilies. They are endemic to western North America, from Oregon to Baja California, and are mostly found in California. The Soap Plants grow as perennial plants, from a bulb, more or less elongated depending on the species. The bulbs can be white or brown, and in most species are very fibrous. The leaves grow from the base of the plant. The flowers are borne on a long central stem, and appear to have six rather separate petals (not all are petals in the technical sense). There are 6 stamens, which are rather prominent in most species. The placement of the genus Chlorogalum is currently uncertain. Until the 1980s, it was generally treated in the Lily family, Liliaceae, in the order Liliales, and conservative taxonomic sources such as ITIS still put it there. The consensus of more recent classifications has been that this is untenable, and for a time Chlorogalum was placed in the hyacinth family Hyacinthaceae, in the order Asparagales. According to Pfosser and Speta (1999), however, molecular systematics now shows that this placement too is wrong at the family level, though they confirm that the genus should be within the Asperagales. Pfosser and Speta conclude that, along with genus Camassia, Chlorogalum seems to be most closely related to the families Agavaceae, Funkiaceae and Anthericaceae. The emerging consensus seems to be that these two genera should be placed in an expanded Agavaceae. Five species are currently classified in the genus. All except the Wavy-leafed Soap Plant, Chlorogalum pomeridianum, have rather restricted distributions, with little overlap. The Wavy-leafed Soap Plant, however, has a range that virtually encompasses those of all other members of the genus, and is the most common of them. Narrow-leaf Soap Plant, Chlorogalum angustifolium, found in the inner north Pacific Coast Ranges of California and southern Oregon and the Sierra Nevada foothills Red Hills Soaproot, Chlorogalum grandiflorum, found in the north and central Sierra Nevada foothills Small-flowered Soaproot Chlorogalum parviflorum, found in the south coastal region of California, south of Santa Barbara, and into Baja California Wavy-leafed Soap Plant, Chlorogalum pomeridianum, found anywhere in California except the higher Sierra Nevada and the deserts, and also in south-western Oregon Purple Amole, Chlorogalum purpureum, found in the Outer South Coast Ranges of California, south of Monterey Bay and north of Santa Barbara

Romneya is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the poppy family. The species, commonly known as Matilija poppies or Tree poppies, are native to southern California and northern Mexico. They are perennial subshrubs with a woody stem. They may grow to a height of 2.5 meters (8 ft) and a width of 1 m (35 in), with the flowers up to 13 cm (5 in) across. The silvery green leaves are deeply cut, with a small fringe of hairs at the margin. They are notable for their large white flowers with intense yellow centers, blooming in summer. These flowers prefer a warm, sunny spot and fertile soil with good water drainage. They are not easily grown, and also difficult to remove. The genus includes only two species: Romneya coulteri Harvey - Coulter's Matilija poppy Romneya trichocalyx Eastwood - Bristly Matilija poppy. Some consider this a variant of Romneya coulteri var. trichocalyx

James Howard McGrath (November 28, 1903 \u2013 September 2, 1966) was an American politician and attorney from the U.S. state of Rhode Island. McGrath, a Democrat, served as U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island before becoming Governor, U.S. Solicitor General, U.S. Senator, chairman of the Democratic National Committee and Attorney General of the United States. McGrath was born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. He graduated from La Salle Academy in 1922, from Providence College in 1926, and from Boston University in 1929. From 1930 to 1934 he was the city solicitor of Central Falls, Rhode Island. During this time he was also interested in the real estate, insurance, and banking industries. He served as United States Attorney for the District of Rhode Island from 1934 to 1940. From 1940 until 1945, he was Governor of Rhode Island, reorganizing the juvenile court system while sponsoring a workers' compensation fund and a labor relations board, but he resigned in the middle of his third term to accept appointment as Solicitor General of the United States (1945-46). McGrath was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate from Rhode Island in 1946, joining an 80th Congress (1947-49) that had unaccustomed Republican majorities in both houses. He was briefly chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on the District of Columbia for the 81st Congress (to which the 1948 election had returned Democratic majorities). In the Senate, McGrath opposed reducing wartime economic controls and taxes, wishing to spend the latter instead on Social Security, national health insurance and education. He was chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1947 to 1949. In managing President Harry Truman's successful 1948 election campaign, McGrath alienated white Southerners but won over crucial black constituencies by integrating the Democratic national headquarters staff. President Truman appointed Sen. McGrath Attorney General of the United States on August 24, 1949. He resigned on April 3, 1952, after he had refused to cooperate in a corruption investigation initiated by his own department. Truman asked for and received McGrath's resignation. McGrath entered the private practice of law in Washington, D.C. , and Providence. In 1960, he was an unsuccessful candidate to succeed the retiring U.S. Sen. Theodore Francis Green (Democrat of Rhode Island), losing the Democratic primary (also contested by former Gov. Dennis J. Roberts) to Claiborne Pell. McGrath died in Narragansett, Rhode Island, in 1966, aged 62, and is buried in St. Francis Cemetery, Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

Donna De Lory is a singer, dancer and songwriter. Part of a musical family, De Lory has been performing since a young age. Her voice can be heard on albums by Carly Simon, Ray Parker, Jr. , Kim Carnes, Santana, Laura Branigan, Belinda Carlisle, French singer Mylene Farmer and Madonna, the latter whom De Lory accompanied as Backing Singer/Dancer on every concert from the Who's That Girl Tour in 1987 up to the Confessions Tour in 2006. Her performance with Madonna at the Live Earth 2007 concert in London was their final professional collaboration to date. A very pregnant De Lory is committed to her own solo tour for the first six weeks of Madonna's 2008 Sticky &amp; Sweet world tour and this will mark the first occasion in more than 21 years that De Lory has not been a member of Madonna's touring company. De Lory's 1993 single \"Just A Dream\" was written and produced by Madonna &amp; Patrick Leonard. The track was originally recorded by Madonna for her 1989 Like a Prayer album. The original version of this song remains an example of unreleased Madonna songs. De Lory's cover version incorporates prominent background vocals by Madonna. A number of remixes for this single were released on promotional CD and 12\" vinyl. De Lory's version did also manage to crack the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart. After traveling the globe in support of her self-titled MCA debut, De Lory's pop and world influences took root in her collaboration with cellist, Cameron Stone. Together they formed a musical hybrid and began creating albums such as Bliss and In the Glow. De Lory\u2019s album The Lover &amp; The Beloved is a Sanskrit and English CD released on Ajna Music, a record label emerging as a leader in the metro-spiritual music genre. While a collection of ancient Indian mantras set to modern beats may seem like a departure, for De Lory, this seamless blend of east and west, devotion and pop, is just the next step in her continuing musical evolution. The De Lory family is well-known in the music industry: Donna is the daughter of musician/record producer/arranger Al De Lory, who played piano, electric organ, and harpsichord on The Beach Boys's Pet Sounds album and was responsible, among other things, for Glen Campbell's three-album \"golden era\" on Capitol Records. De Lory performs Elise's theme, \"My Destiny\", in the 2006 game Sonic the Hedgehog. Her song, \"In the Sun\" was featured at the end of episode 5 of NBC's drama Life.

Sandy Skoglund (born 11 September 1946) is an American photographer and installation artist. Skoglund creates surrealist images by building elaborate sets or tableaux, furnishing them with carefully selected colored furniture and other objects, a process of which takes her months to complete. Finally, she photographs the set, complete with actors. The works are characterized by an overwhelming amount of one object and either bright, contrasting colors or a monochromatic color scheme. Skoglund studied both art history and studio art at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, graduating in 1968. In 1967, she studied art history at the Sorbonne and \u00C9cole du Louvre in Paris, France. After graduating from Smith College, she went to graduate school at the University of Iowa in 1969, where she studied filmmaking, multimedia art, and printmaking. In 1971, she earned her Master of Arts and in 1972 a Master of Fine Arts in painting. In 1972, Skoglund began working as a conceptual artist in New York.

One of her most-known photographs, entitled Radioactive Cats, features green-painted clay cats running amok in a gray kitchen. An older man sits in a chair with his back facing the camera while his elderly wife looks into a refrigerator that is the same color as the walls. Another image, Fox Games has a similar feel to Radioactive Cats and is also widely recognized. A third and final oft-recognized piece by her features numerous fish hovering above people in bed late at night and is called Revenge of the Goldfish. The piece was used as cover art for the Inspiral Carpets album of the same name. Skoglund was an art professor at the University of Hartford between 1973 and 1976. She is currently teaching photography and art installation/multimedia at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Skoglund has recently completed a series titled \"True Fiction Two\". This recent project is similar to the \"True Fiction\" series that she began in 1986. This series was not completed due to the discontinuation of materials that Skoglund was using. Kodak canceled the production of the dye that Skoglund was using for her prints. Each image in \"True Fiction Two\" has been meticulously crafted to assimilate the visual and photographic possibilities now available in digital processes. Her works are held in numerous museum collections including the Museum of Contemporary Photography, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and Dayton Art Institute.

His inventive use of complex three-dimensional forms, warm materials, and striking colors, as well as his ability to work successfully within tight budgets, however, have placed him as one of the true s of early twentieth century architecture. Mostly, his work escaped widespread publication during his lifetime, but has developed a critical resurgence since the 1980s.

Henry Clay Work (October 1, 1832 - June 8, 1884) was an American composer and songwriter. He was born in Middletown, Connecticut, to Alanson and Amelia (Forbes) Work. His father opposed slavery, and Work was himself an active abolitionist and Union supporter. His family's home became a stop on the Underground Railroad, assisting runaway slaves to freedom in Canada, for which his father was once imprisoned. Work was self taught in music. By the time he was 23, he worked as a printer in Chicago, specializing in setting musical type. He allegedly composed in his head as he worked, without a piano, using the noise of the machinery as an inspiration. His first published song was \"We Are Coming, Sister Mary\", which eventually became a staple in Christy's Minstrels shows. Work produced much of his best material during the Civil War. In 1862 he published \"Kingdom Coming\" using his own lyrics based upon snippets of Negro speech he had heard. This use of slave dialect (Irish too was a favourite) tended to limit the appeal of Work's works and make them frowned upon today. However, \"Kingdom Coming\" appeared in the Jerome Kern show \"Good Morning, Dearie\" on Broadway in 1921, and was heard in the background in the 1944 Judy Garland film \"Meet Me in St. Louis\". 1862 also saw his novelty song \"Grafted Into the Army\", followed in 1863 by \"Babylon is Fallen\", \"The Song of a Thousand Years\", and \"God Save the Nation\". His 1864 effort \"Wake Nicodemus\" was popular in minstrel shows. In 1865 he wrote his greatest hit, inspired by Sherman's march to the sea, \"Marching Through Georgia\" at the end of the previous year. Thanks to its lively melody, the song was immensely popular, its million sheet-music sales being unprecedented. It is a cheerful marching song and has since been pressed into service many times, including by Princeton University as a football fight song. Timothy Shay Arthur's play Ten Nights in a Barroom, had Work's 1864 \"Come Home, Father\", a dirgesome song bemoaning the demon drink too mawkish for modern tastes, but which has always been sung at Temperance Meetings.

George Barris grew up in New York City before the World War II. His interest in photography was lifelong, and as a young man he worked for the U.S. Army's Office of Public Relations. Many of his phtographs of General Eisenhower were published. After the war, he became a freelance photographer and readily found work in Hollywood. He photographed many stars of the 1950s and 1960s, including Elizabeth Taylor on the set of Cleopatra. He is perhaps best known for his work with Marilyn Monroe, however, with whom he was collaborating on a book at the time of her death. As part of this project, he is believed to have taken the last photographs of Monroe while she was alive. He did not allow these to be published until many years after her death. George Barris and famed photographer Bert Stern claim to have taken the 'last picture' of Marilyn Monroe, when neither of them did, since photographer Allan Grant photographed Monroe on July 7, 1962 for a LIFE Magazine article. This article was printed just two days before Monroe's death.

Datura wrightii or Sacred Datura is the name of a poisonous perennial plant and ornamental flower of southwestern North America. It is sometimes used as a hallucinogen. Datura wrightii is classified as a deliriant and an anticholinergic. It is a vigorous herbaceous perennial that grows 30 cm to 1.5 m tall and wide. The leaves are broad and rounded at the base, tapering to a point, often with wavy margins. The flowers are the most striking feature, being sweetly fragrant white trumpets up to 20 cm (8 inches) long, often tinted purple, especially at the margin.

William Edmond Lescaze (Onex, Switzerland, 27 March 1896 &ndash; New York, New York, 9 February 1969) was a Swiss-born American architect, and is one of the pioneers of modernism in American architecture. Lescaze completed his formal education at the \u00C9cole polytechnique f\u00E9d\u00E9rale de Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland, receiving his degree in 1919, and emigrated to the USA in 1920. He worked for some time at the architectural firm of Hubbell &amp; Benes in Cleveland, Ohio, before setting up his own practice in New York City in 1923. Through the 1920s and 1930s he continued to travel across the Atlantic. In 1929, Philadelphia architect George Howe invited Lescaze to form a partnership, which was named Howe &amp; Lescaze. Within just a few weeks after joining forces, the duo began work on a large project for downtown Philadelphia. The resulting structure, completed in 1932, was the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS) Building, which is today generally considered the first International Modernist skyscraper, and the first International Style building of wide significance in the United States. Lescaze is generally given credit for the design: letters from Howe to Lescaze quote the former insisting to the latter that \"the design is definitely yours. \" The structure replaced the bank's former headquarters in Philadelphia, a classicist structure near Washington Square built in 1897. Lescaze submitted a design for the proposed Museum of Modern Art in New York, in 1932. The wood and metal model was donated to the MOMA in 1994. Lescaze was also the design lead for the 1937 Williamsburg Houses in Brooklyn, a pioneering 20-building modernist housing project modeled on European examples. He later taught industrial design at the Pratt Institute (1943-1945). Among his built works were the CBS West Coast studios Columbia Square on Sunset Boulevard.

His father, Jerry Bloedow, b. 1928, is a playwright, poet and film editor, whose theater, the Hardware Poet's Playhouse, was a fixture in the New York avante-garde scene in the 1950s and early 60s. Oren's first serious musical affiliations were with Phillip Johnston, Bobby Previte and Wayne Horvitz, all of whom worked with him in Bobby Radcliff's blues band in the 1980s. With Radcliff, Oren backed up Dr. John, Otis Rush and Johnny Copeland, also Paul Butterfield shortly before he died. Another close collaboration was with underground guitarist Ron Anderson, later of San Francisco's the Molecules. In 1985, a friend of Ron's introduced Oren to 101 Crustaceans, whose leader, Ed Pastorini, is Oren's oldest continuing musical associate, and was later a member of Elysian Fields. Oren consistently names Ed Pastorini as his favorite musical artist. He attended New England Conservatory in 1987-88, and on returning, started gigging frequently at the Knitting Factory on Houston St. Previte, Horvitz and Johnston were all playing there, and so were many musicians Oren came to play with, like Samm Bennett, The Jazz Passengers, Marc Ribot, Bosho, Gary Lucas and innumerable others. It was here in 1990 that Oren met Jennifer, and they began working together soon afterwards. During the nineties, Oren made a couple of solo records for the Knitting Factory label, one featuring Medeski, Martin and Wood, toured and recorded as a member of The Lounge Lizards for whom he played bass, as well as many other groups and projects.

Sim Van der Ryn is acknowledged as a leader in \"sustainable architecture. \" He is also a researcher and educator. Van der Ryn's driving professional interest has been applying principles of physical and social ecology to architecture and environmental design. Van der Ryn distinguished himself among those designers and planners who have pioneered sustainable design at the community scale and the building-specific scale. He has designed everything from single-family and multi-family housing, to community facilities, retreat centers and resorts, to learning facilities, as well as office and commercial buildings . Sim Van der Ryn's family left the Netherlands during World War II, settling in Kew Gardens, Queens, then eventually Great Neck, New York. Sim grew up with a sense of closeness with nature and a fascination with its details. He got his training in architecture at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and obtained state architecture licenses and national architectural registration. He has long lived in California. In the exploratory and energetic latter part of the 20th century, Van der Ryn and other architects and designers with similar interests were able to pioneer new technologies, systems, materials, and design solutions to create environments intended to be sensitive to place and climate, as well as responsive to human needs. Van der Ryn was appointed California State Architect in the administration of Governor Jerry Brown, during which time he developed the United States' first government-initiated energy efficient office building program and led adoption of energy standards and disability access standards for all construction in California. In the 1970s Van der Ryn founded the Farallones Institute which helped to create national awareness of \"ecologically integrated living design. \" The Farallones Institute designed, built and managed an urban and a rural research/teaching center for studying appropriate technologies, energy-efficiency, organic agriculture, land restoration, community design and ecologically sustainable energy and waste systems, design and construction. The urban center was called the Integral Urban House. Van der Ryn later founded the Ecological Design Institute (EDI), Van der Ryn Architects' non-profit partner, which carries on this work. \"The worst thing you can do is keep making no changes,\" Van der Ryn once said while addressing an assembly of architects. \"That's where the risk lies. \" Given America's dependence on foreign oil, he has proposed (as an instance), energy security is one of the country's greatest challenges and the status quo won't do. U.S. companies, he believes, would pay more attention to \"green\" buildings if their operational costs for energy bills were calculated on the same balance sheet as construction costs. Van der Ryn has reported he has noticed, while driving around America, that many builders still seem to pay no attention to one of the cheapest ways to save on energy bills: positioning the house on its site to maximize passive solar heat. Sim Van der Ryn has been presented with numerous honors and awards, including: the Goff Chair of Innovative Architecture, University of Oklahoma (2001); Fellowship of the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts (1997); Rockefeller Scholar in Residence, Bellagio, Italy (1997); the President's Award for Planning, American Society of Landscape Architects; Arbolera de Vida Master Plan, Albuquerque, New Mexico (1997); the Nathaniel Owings Award, California Council American Institute of Architects (1996); a Commendation for Excellence in Technology, California Council American Institute of Architects (1981); and a Guggenheim Fellowship (1971). Van der Ryn is in the architecture faculty at the University of California, Berkeley.
Tom Bender began to make his mark in the early 1970s as an architect, author, and strategic planner. He has since been visible also as a writer in the emerging field of green economics. He has also studied and written about traditional architectural philosophies of Asia. Tom Bender is considered to be one of the American founders of the \"green architecture\" and \"sustainability\" movements. His research, writing, and architectural design since the 1970s has embraced the relatively new field of solar architectural design. Bender was an associate professor of architecture in the University of Minnesota. Like Amory Lovins and some other modern analysts, Bender has subscribed to the reduction of energy usage (often through the decrease of on-site energy wastage) rather than a massive increase of centralized energy-production facilities in a society. Tom Bender moved west to Oregon, where he served as an energy researcher for Governor Tom McCall during the so-called Arab Oil Crisis of the early 1970s. During that decade, Bender was also the co-editor of RAIN Magazine (a journal concerned with appropriate technology), and, among the theorists and practitioners of the \"green\" approach to planning and design, has been a popular essayist since that time. In the 1970s as well, Bender began to develop what he has termed \"Factor 10\" economics. These are principles of design and planning that he asserted will achieve order-of-magnitude improvements in economic effectiveness and sustainability. These principles have received interest from governments of Austria, the Netherlands, and Norway, as well as endorsement by the European Union, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and UNEP. Tom Bender has been the recipient of such awards as: the California Affordable Housing Award (1981); Sustainable Community Solutions international competition award (the American Institute of Architects &amp; International Union of Architects, 1993); the National Award for Sustainable Design (AIA Architecture and Energy Program, 2001) and Top 10 Green Buildings (2002) from the AIA for his Bank of Astoria project in Manzanita, Oregon.

Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry is a documentary film on U.S. Senator John Kerry's military service during the Vietnam War and his subsequent participation in the peace movement. There is significant emphasis on Kerry's famous speech before a Senate committee, historical footage from the Winter Soldier Investigations, and coverage of the Dewey Canyon III anti-war demonstrations in Washington, D.C. The majority of the film is composed of archival footage, with much of it in the original black-and-white format. From the producer's website, (retrieved Oct. 1, 2004): \"This is a feature length documentary about character and moral leadership during a time of national crisis. Loosely based on the best-selling book Tour of Duty by Douglas Brinkley, Going Upriver examines the story of John Kerry and the key events that made him a national figure and the man he is today. \"Going Upriver director George Butler (best known for his highly acclaimed films Pumping Iron, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger and ') first realized Kerry\u2019s importance to his generation and began documenting his journey in photographs in 1969, covering Kerry's leadership of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), his early political campaigns, as well as intimate moments of his personal life. The film weaves together Butler\u2019s extraordinary photographs with archival film, interviews with Kerry\u2019s closest associates, and more contemporary images of the Senator at home and abroad. \" Going Upriver is the culmination of a forty-year friendship between Kerry and George Butler. They first met in 1964 while Butler was a reporter and photographer, and published a book together (\"The New Soldier,\" about Vietnam vets and the Anti-war Movement) in 1971. Butler has documented Kerry's political career with thousands of photographs, and Kerry is godfather to one of Butler's sons. Butler builds a portrait of Kerry through conversations with the men who served with him, people who went to college with him, and relatives. He narrows the story to Vietnam, and uses vintage footage to show the duty to which Kerry asked to be transferred. The recollections from his shipmates, and shots of battle and battle damage on his and other swift boats, underscores the nature of the duty and Kerry's performance of it. The video of his TV appearances and congressional testimony when he got back provides the context to Kerry's change of heart on the war and his determination to see to it that his comrades stopped dying over there. Considerable attention is paid to the lesser known activities and details behind some of that era's most tumultuous events, such as the occupying of the Washington Mall despite court injunctions and the two marches to the Arlington National Cemetery. Descriptive narrative often gives way to the more powerful messages conveyed by the expressions and actions of participants caught on film at these events. Some of the footage shot in Vietnam could be considered mildly graphic. Going Upriver was first pre-released at the Toronto International Film Festival under the \"Real to Reel\" documentary category on September 9 through September 18, 2004.

Darlingtonia californica, also called the California Pitcher plant, Cobra Lily, or Cobra Plant, is a carnivorous plant, the sole member of the genus Darlingtonia in the family Sarraceniaceae. It is native to Northern California and Oregon, growing in bogs and seeps with cold running water. This plant is designated as uncommon due to its rarity in the field. The name Cobra Lily stems from the resemblance of its tubular leaves to a rearing cobra, complete with a forked leaf - ranging from yellow to purplish-green - that resemble fangs or a serpent's tongue. The plant was discovered in 1841 by the botanist William D. Brackenridge at Mount Shasta. In 1853 it was described by John Torrey, who named the genus Darlingtonia after the Philadelphian botanist William Darlington (1782-1863).

Harry Morey Callahan (October 22, 1912 \u2013 March 15, 1999) was an American photographer who is considered one of the great innovators of modern American photography. He was born in Detroit, Michigan and started photographing in 1938 as an autodidact. By 1946, he was appointed by L\u00E1szl\u00F3 Moholy-Nagy to teach photography at the Institute of Design in Chicago. Callahan retired in 1977, at which time he was teaching at the Rhode Island School of Design. Callahan left almost no written records--no diaries, letters, scrapbooks or teaching notes. His technical photographic method was to go out almost every morning, walk the city he lived in and take numerous pictures. He then spent almost every afternoon making proof prints of that day's best negatives. Yet, for all his photographic activity, Callahan, at his own estimation, produced no more than half a dozen final images a year. He photographed his wife, Eleanor, and daughter, Barbara, and the streets, scenes and buildings of cities where he lived, showing a strong sense of line and form, and light and darkness. He also worked with multiple exposures. Callahan's work was a deeply personal response to his own life. He was well known to encourage his students to turn their cameras on their lives, and he led by example. Callahan photographed his wife over a period of fifteen years, as his prime subject. Eleanor was essential to his art from 1947 to 1960. He photographed her everywhere - at home, in the city streets, in the landscape; alone, with their daughter, in black and white and in color, nude and clothed, distant and close. He tried several technical experiments - double and triple exposure, blurs, large and small format film. In 1950 his daughter Barbara, was born. Even prior to her birth she showed up in photographs of Eleanor's pregnancy. From 1948 to 1953 Eleanor, and sometimes Barbara, were shown out in the landscape as a tiny counterpoint to large expanses of park, skyline or water. In 1996, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. Callahan died in Atlanta in 1999. He left behind 100,000 negatives and over 10,000 proof prints. The Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona, which actively collects, preserves and makes available individual works by 20th-century North American photographers, maintains his photographic archives. His estate is represented in New York by the Pace/MacGill Gallery.

Carroll Cloar (January 18, 1913 &ndash; April 10, 1993) was a nationally known 20th century painter born in Earle, Arkansas, who focused his work on surreal views of Southern U.S. themes and on poetically portraying childhood memories of natural scenery, buildings, and people, often working from old photographs found in his family albums. Guy Northrop, in his introduction on page 24 to Hostile Butterflies and Other Paintings by Carroll Cloar, (1977), quoted Cloar describing his images as \"American faces, timeless dress and timeless customs ... the last of old America that isn't long for this earth. \" His Panther Bourne work depicted a surreal, Southern-mythic nature scene. Cloar employed pointillism in his painting \"Waiting up for Lettie,\" creating over 800 works in his lifetime. He moved to Memphis in 1930, attending Southwestern at Memphis College (later known as Rhodes College) as an English major. His recurrent themes of a \"homecoming,\" implying that the essential beauty of a locale is best understood by one who has left a beloved place behind and then returned, are echoed in his own personal experience of traveling abroad for years and then returning to the South. He began his travels in Europe after college, before returning to Memphis to study at Memphis College of Art. He studied at the Art Students League of New York from 1936 to 1940. A series of lithographs he created in that period of the landscape and people of his Earle, Arkansas, hometown led to his receipt of a McDowell Traveling Fellowship in 1940.

He traveled around Central and South America until 1950. His first one-man show was held in 1953 in Memphis.

Lilium humboldtii (Humboldt's lily) is a species of lily endemic to California named after naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt. It is native to the South High Cascade Range, High Sierra Nevada, south Outer South Coast Ranges, and Southwestern California, growing at elevations from 600 metres (2,000 ft) to 1,200 metres (3,900 ft). It grows up to 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, with flowers that are maroon-spotted, golden-orange with dark red splotches, with orange to brown stamens. The plant flowers in June, with flowers growing in a pyramidal inflorescence. The flowers are on stout stems, which are sometimes brown-purple. The subrhizomatous bulb is large, with yellowish-white scales, and grows very deep in the soil. The leaves grow in whorls, and are undulate, shiny, and oblanceolate. It is summer-deciduous, dying back after flowering in mid- to late summer. There are two subspecies, Lilium humboldtii subsp. humboldtii, and Lilium humboldtii subsp. ocellatum.

George Herbert Wyman (1860 &ndash; 1939) was an American architect, most noted for designing the Bradbury Building (304 South Broadway) in Los Angeles. Wyman was born in Dayton and on leaving school was apprenticed in the architects office of his uncle, Luthor Peters. He moved to Los Angeles in 1891 where he worked as a draughtsman in the offices of Sumner Hunt. In 1892 Hunt was approached by the mining millionaire Lewis Bradbury to construct a landmark building for a site in down town Los Angeles. Disappointed with Hunt's design, Bradbury took the surprising step of asking the young Wyman to design the building, despite the fact that Wyman had no formal qualifications as an architect and hadn't previously designed a building. Quite why Bradbury did this is not clear, but it is possible that whilst visiting Hunt's offices, he met Wyman and was inspired by some sketches that Wyman had been working on. Wyman had been toying with the design of a futuristic building described in Edward Bellamy's science fiction novel and social commentary, Looking Backward:From 2000-1887 (chapter 10). In the utopian society of the year 2000 the hero is taken to visit a commercial store: It was the first interior of a twentieth-century public building that I had ever beheld, and the spectacle naturally impressed me deeply. I was in a vast hall full of light, received not alone from the windows on all sides, but from the dome, the point of which was a hundred feet above. Beneath it, in the centre of the hall, a magnificent fountain played, cooling the atmosphere to a delicious freshness with its spray. The walls and ceiling were frescoed in mellow tints, calculated to soften without absorbing the light which flooded the interior. Around the fountain was a space occupied with chairs and sofas, on which many persons were seated conversing. With the exception of the fountain, the description neatly fits the interior which Wyman achieved in the Bradbury building just six years after Bellamy's book was published. According to a story told by Wyman's grandson, the famous sci-fi figure Forrest J Ackerman, Wyman was troubled by the responsibility of taking on the commission. Both he and his wife Belle were Spiritualists and the couple decided to consult the spirits for guidance. Using a planchette, a device similar to a Ouija board, they traced out the message Mark Wyman take the Bradbury building and you will be... Successful. Mark Wyman was George's younger brother who had died aged 8. At first they had trouble reading the final word, as it was written upside down in relation to the rest of the message . As a result, Wyman accepted the commission, and Bradbury was pleased with the drawings and plans for a five story building at the corner of Broadway and Third Street. The building was completed a year later in 1893 although costs spiralled from $175,000 to $500,000, largely as a result of Bradbury specifying the best quality materials for all aspects of the construction. The Bradbury building was met with critical acclaim including a positive review in Arts and Architecture magazine. However it was Wyman's only major success. In the following years, Wyman received numerous commissions for new buildings. He decided to bolster his qualification with an architectural correspondence course, but this seems to have turned him away from using interior light as an architectural element. His office buildings took on a heavy solid style and most have subsequently been demolished, whilst the Bradbury building is still much celebrated.

That's Dancing! is a retrospective documentary produced by MGM that looked back at the history of dancing in film. Unlike the That's Entertainment! series, this film did not focus specifically on MGM films and included more recent performances by the likes of John Travolta and Michael Jackson and from the then-popular films Fame (1980) and Flashdance (1983), as well as classic films from other studios, including Carousel, released by 20th Century Fox, and Oklahoma!, released by Magna Corporation (roadshow) and 20th Century Fox (general release). A highlight of the film was the first theatrical release of a complete dance routine by Ray Bolger for his \"If I Only Had a Brain\" number that had been shortened in The Wizard of Oz. The hosts for this film are Gene Kelly (who also executive produced), Ray Bolger (his last film appearance before his death in 1987), Liza Minnelli, Sammy Davis Jr. , and Mikhail Baryshnikov. Pop singer Kim Carnes was commissioned to sing an original song, \"Invitation to Dance,\" that plays over the closing credits. This film is sometimes considered part of the That's Entertainment! series, especially since its starting credits contain a card with the That's Entertainment! III title (not to be confused with the 1994 film), but even though it shared studio and producers, it is considered a separate production. Jack Haley Jr. , who wrote, produced and directed the first That's Entertainment! film, also wrote and directed this one, co-producing with longtime friend David Niven, Jr.. Haley's father, Jack Haley, had co-starred with Bolger in Wizard of Oz. That's Dancing! was not included when the three That's Entertainment! films were released on DVD in 2004; it was instead released on its own in 2007. The DVD includes several behind-the-scenes promotional featurettes from 1985 on the making of the film, as well as its accompanying music video featuring Kim Carnes singing \"Invitation to Dance\" although the DVD omits both the video and song itself.

Joel Meyerowitz (born in 1938,the Bronx New York City) is a street photographer who began photographing in color in 1962 and was an early advocate of the use of color during a time when there was significant resistance to the idea of color photography as serious art. In the early 70's he taught the first color course at Cooper Union where many of today's renowned color photographers studied with him. He made a significant change to large format color photography in 1976, and along with Stephen Shore and William Eggleston became the first group of young artists to use color exclusively. Their work, seen and published in America and Europe, influenced the next generation's, particularly the young German artists', turn toward using color in photography. He is the author of 16 books including the seminal book, Cape Light. Meyerowitz often uses an 8x10 large format camera to produce photographs of places and people. Meyerowitz graduated from Ohio State University in 1959 with a degree in painting and medical illustration. Inspired by Robert Frank's book The Americans and by the work of Garry Winogrand, Meyerowitz took to the streets with a 35mm camera and black and white film. He also drew inspiration from Eugene Atget, whence the seeds of his most renowned work were planted. \"In the pantheon of greats there is Robert Frank and there is Atget. \" Meyerowitz goes on to say that \"those two visions of the world captivated me early on, opened me up. \" Meyerowitz has published a photographic archive of the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, and was the only photographer allowed unrestricted access to ground zero immediately following the attack.

Danny Lyon (born 1942), is a self-taught American photographer and filmmaker. He is also credited as an accomplished writer to accompany his photographs. He studied history at the University of Chicago, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1963. That same year, he published his first photographs working for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. His pictures appeared in The Movement, a documentary book about the Southern Civil Rights Movement. Later, Lyon began creating his own books. His first, was a study of outlaw motorcyclists in the collection Bikeriders (1967), where Lyon did more than just photograph motorcyclists in the American Midwest from 1963 to 1967. Additionally, he also became a member of the Chicago Outlaws motorcycle club and traveled with them, sharing their lifestyle. According to Lyon himself, the photographs were \"an attempt to record and glorify the life of the American bikerider. \" The series was immensely popular and influential in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1970s, he also contributed to the Environmental Protection Agency's DOCUMERICA project. The Destruction of Lower Manhattan was Lyon's next work, published by Macmillan Publishers in 1969. The book documents the large-scale demolition taking place throughout Lower Manhattan in 1967. Included are photographs of soon to be demolished streets and buildings, portraits of the neighborhood's last remaining stragglers and pictures from within the demolition sites themselves. The book originally sold for one dollar each, but soon attained the status of a collector's item. It was later reprinted in 2005. Conversations with the Dead (1971), was published with full cooperation of the Texas Department of Corrections. Lyon photographed in six prisons over a fourteen month period in 1967 to 1968. The series was printed to book in 1971 by Holt publishing. The introduction of Lyon's book points to a statement of purpose that the penal system of Texas is symbolic for incarceration everywhere. He states, \"I tried with whatever power I had to make a picture of imprisonment as distressing as I knew it to be in reality. \" Lyon befriended many of the prisoners. The book also includes texts taken from prison records, letters from the convicts, and inmate artwork. In particular, the book focuses on the case of Billy McCune, a convicted rapist whose death sentence was commuted to life in prison during the climax of the book's popularity. In the foreword, Lyon describes Billy as a diagnosed psychotic, who one evening, while awaiting execution, \"cut his penis off to the root and, placing it in a cup, passed it between the bars to the guard. \" All of Lyon's publications work in the style of photographic \"New Journalism\", meaning that the photographer has become immersed, and is a participant, of the documented subject. Danny Lyon received the Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship for photography in 1969, and in film making in 1979. He has had solo exhibits at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona.

Malcolm Wells (March 11, 1926 &ndash; November 27, 2009) is sometimes regarded as \"the father of modern earth-sheltered architecture. \" Wells lived on Cape Cod, and practiced what he preached by living in a modern earth-sheltered building of his own design. Wells was also a writer, illustrator, draftsman, lecturer, cartoonist, columnist, and solar consultant. Malcolm Wells retired from the active practice of architecture in June 2004, although he continued his advocacy for underground living to the end of his life. There is an active Yahoo Group in which his works are discussed. His work in architecture and design began in 1953. After 10 years \"spent spreading corporate asphalt on America in the name of architecture,\" he began to feel that the Earth's surface was \"made for living plants, not industrial plants;\" and took up the challenge of underground architecture. This was reflected in his semi-underground office at Cuthbert Blvd and Park Blvd in Cherry Hill, NJ, adjacent to the Cooper River. His interests are in energy efficiency, aesthetics, land preservation and restoration \"A Regeneration-based Checklist for Design and Construction\", and durability of materials, among other aspects. His books have sold over 120,000 copies to similarly minded designers and to laymen alike. Wells died Friday, November 27, 2009, with his wife Karen North Wells and son John Wells at his side.

In his last two seasons, 1970-71, Ralston's teams won two Pacific-8 titles and back-to-back Rose Bowl victories over Ohio State and Michigan. During Ralston's tenure at the school, Stanford quarterback Jim Plunkett won the 1970 Heisman Trophy. In 1972, Ralston departed the Bay Area once again, this time for the Rocky Mountains and the Denver Broncos. The following year, he was UPI's choice as AFC Coach of the Year after Denver achieved its first-ever-winning season at 7-5-2.

In 1974, Ralston coached the Broncos to a 7-6-1 record, for their second winning season in a row. The 1975 season was a season of mediocre football for the Broncos and the team finished with a disappointing 6-8 record, but the following year the team played strong and finished with an impressive 9-5 record. However the record was not good enough to get the Broncos into the playoffs. Despite the strong showing Bronco players issued a protest vote of no confidence, and Coach John Ralston resigned following the season. After leaving the Broncos, Ralston held several assistant coaching jobs which included, the Philadelphia Eagles, the San Francisco 49ers, the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, and as a head coach in the USFL with the Oakland Invaders.

Jack Gaughan (September 24, 1930 - July 21, 1985) was an American science fiction artist and illustrator who won the Hugo Award several times. Working primarily with Donald A. Wollheim at Ace Books and later DAW Books, and also Galaxy Magazine during the late 1960s, his simple linear style brought to life unforgettable images of such classics as Andre Norton's Witch World Novels and Edward Elmer Smith's Lensmen and Skylark novels (for which he did two related sets of Pyramid Books covers). His broad visual vocabulary enabled him to render the objects, spaceships and scenes in whatever was presented to him as they were described in the books and stories he illustrated. That was especially an accomplishment as many of these authors drew on their knowledge of very esoteric subjects for their imagery. This ability made him very popular among people with an engineering background. During most of Ejler Jakobsson's tenure at Galaxy Magazine from 1969 to 1974 he did all the illustration and much of the design that went on in the magazine. In addition, many of the books he did for Ace featured frontpieces, hand-lettered titled pages or maps at the front with Gaughan's distinctive calligraphy. An example would be Alan Garner's The Weirdstone of Brisingamen. L. Sprague de Camp's 1967 anthology, The Fantastic Swordsmen included a Gaughan map before each of the stories in it. Most notoriously, he did the covers and hand-lettered title pages for the Ace Books' edition of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. As well as his professional work, he was a frequent contributor to SF fan magazines. Locus ran a column by him for a while, and in his heyday he was often nominated for Hugo Awards for both professional artist and best fan artist simultaneously. In his memory, the New England Science Fiction Association presents the Jack Gaughan Award for best emerging sf illustrator.

Evalyn Walsh McLean (August 1, 1886, in Leadville, Colorado \u2013 April 26, 1947 in Washington, D.C. ) was an American mining heiress and socialite who was famous for being the last private owner of the 45 carats (9.0 g; 140 gr) Hope Diamond as well as another famous diamond, the 94 carats (19 g) Star of the East. She also was the author, with Boyden Sparkes, of a memoir, Father Struck It Rich. She was the only daughter of Thomas Walsh, an Irish immigrant miner and prospector turned multimillionaire, and his wife, Carrie Bell Reed, a former schoolteacher. In 1908, she married Edward Beale McLean, the heir to the Washington Post and Cincinnati Enquirer publishing fortune. They had four children: Vinson Walsh McLean (who had epilepsy and died at the age of nine, following a traffic accident), Edward Beale McLean Jr, John Roll McLean II, and Emily Washington McLean (who later changed her name to Evalyn Walsh McLean). The couple, whose marriage was rent by infidelity and substance abuse (he was a spectacular alcoholic, while she was addicted to morphine), divorced in 1929, though the decree was invalidated due to the divorce having been illegally obtained in Lithuania. Ned McLean eventually became the common-law husband of Rose Douras, a sister of the Hollywood film star Marion Davies, before dying in a mental institution. The couple's notoriety is reflected by their appearance in Cole Porter's title song to the 1934 musical, Anything Goes: \"When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) Can get Russian reds to \"yes\" her, Then I suppose Anything goes. \" Evalyn Walsh McLean was also a friend and confidante to Alice Roosevelt Longworth and Florence Harding, the wife of Warren G. Harding, the 29th President of the United States. The site of her summer house, Friendship &mdash; a sprawling country mansion built for her father-in-law by John Russell Pope and which was located on Tenleytown Road, N.W. &mdash; is now a condominium complex known as McLean Gardens. (The original house was demolished in the 1940s though some of the property's garden features remain intact, as does the Georgian-style ballroom. ) A later residence, also known as Friendship, is located at the corner of R Street, N.W. and Wisconsin Avenue, and remains a private home. Her childhood home, a grandiose Second Empire-style mansion at 2020 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W. , is now the Indonesian embassy. McLean was a victim of Gaston Means, a former F.B.I. agent, murder suspect, and grifter, who claimed that he had set a deal to free the Lindbergh baby for a ransom of over $100,000 (USD) which Evalyn McLean advanced him. Means disappeared with the money only to resurface months later in California and ask McLean for additional funds. Suspicious of Means' activities, she helped lead police to Means, who was also wanted for other various crimes and civil actions. This ultimately lead to his conviction and imprisonment on larceny charges. Evalyn Walsh McLean died at 60 of pneumonia and was buried in Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington D.C. , in the Walsh family tomb.
Clara Ward (April 21, 1924 \u2013 January 16, 1973) was an American gospel artist who achieved great success, both artistic and commercial, in the 1940s and 1950s as leader of The Famous Ward Singers. A gifted singer and arranger, Ward took the lead-switching style used by male gospel quartets to new heights, leaving room for spontaneous improvisation and vamping by each member of the group while giving virtuouso singers such as Marion Williams the opportunity to step forward in songs such as \"Surely, God Is Able\" (among the first million-selling gospel hits), \"How I Got Over\" (which she wrote; one of the most famous songs in the Black gospel repertoire), and \"Packin' Up\". Ward ranks among the greatest of gospel singers along with Mahalia Jackson, Roberta Martin, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, and others.

Edwin Howland Blashfield (December 5, 1848 \u2013 October 12, 1936), an American artist, was born in New York City. He was a pupil of L\u00E9on Joseph Florentin Bonnat in Paris beginning in 1867, and became (1888) a member of the National Academy of Design in New York. For some years a genre painter, he later turned to decorative work, where his academic background in painting and extensive travels to study fresco painting in Italy melded in work marked by rare delicacy and beauty of coloring. Considered a leading muralist of the late 19th century, he painted mural decorations or created mosaics in a number of places associated with the American Renaissance period. His style is cited as an influence of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Jean-Paul Laurens, and Paul Baudr. With his wife he wrote Italian Cities (1900) and edited Vasari's Lives of the Painters (1896), and was well known as a lecturer and writer on art. He became president of the Society of Mural Painters, and of the Society of American Artists.
The Fontane Sisters were a trio (Bea, Geri and Margi Rosse) from New Milford, New Jersey. Originally they performed with their guitarist brother Frank (1941\u20131944), but he was killed in World War II. They were featured on a radio show done by Perry Como 1945\u20131948 and Como's later television simulcast program in 1948 known as The Chesterfield Supper Club and later (1949\u20131954) as The Perry Como Show. In 1949 they were signed by RCA Records, and did some recordings as backup to Como. In 1951 they had a minor hit with \"The Tennessee Waltz\", of which bigger recordings were done by Patti Page and Les Paul and Mary Ford. In 1954 they switched to Randy Wood's Dot Records, where they had 18 songs in the Billboard Hot 100, 10 in the top 40. The Fontane Sisters retired from show business around 1961, when youngest sister Geri was expecting her daughter. The daughter was named after Geri, and as an adult she went by the name \"Geri Fontane Latchford\"\u2014\"Latchford\" coming from Geri's (the mother's) husband, Al(bert) Latchford. Marge felt that the trio didn't want to continue the \"grind\" of tours and mixing with the newer members of the music scene. The sisters agreed that they did not want to be part of the evolving rock 'n' roll scene. They felt they had become stereotyped as \"cover\" artists and wanted private lives. In 1963, Dot Records did release one last album, Tips of my Fingers, and single (\"Tips of My Fingers\"/\"Summertime Love\") by The Fontane Sisters. But these recordings did not mark a return to performing for the trio, who remained retired despite having agreed to make the recordings for Dot. For the next 40 years, The Fontane Sisters remained out of the public's eye, living normal lives with their families. While many of their fans wondered what had become of them, it was apparently their choice that their private lives remain private. The next definitive word about them came in 2004, when an article in New York Daily News reported that Geri Fontane Latchford had received back royalties due to her mother and two aunts. It was revealed in this same article that all three of The Fontane Sisters had died: Geri (65) in 1993, Bea (77) around 2002, and Marge (80) around 2003.

He eventually became a leading figure in the art colony that had developed in Mystic, and founded the Mystic Art Association in 1913. He became a full member of the National Academy of Design in 1906, and received many awards, including a silver medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1889.

Rebecca Guay is an artist specializing in watercolor painting and illustration. She is mostly known for her work commissioned by, White Wolf, and DC Vertigo comics, though she has also done work for World of Warcraft TCG, the out of print Middle Earth CCG and in Wizards of the Coast games other than Magic: The Gathering (including the role playing game book series Dungeons &amp; Dragons.). She received a degree in Illustration from the Pratt Institute in New York City in 1992 and resides in Amherst, Massachusetts with her husband and daughter. Rebecca Guay has been involved with paintings for Magic: The Gathering since its maturity in the mid to late 1990s, and has been commissioned for anywhere from 3 to 12 cards per release since ' (1996). She remains a fan favorite despite the recent decline in commissioned works by Wizards of the Coast for Magic: The Gathering. Rebecca's style is heavily influenced by and bears a strong resemblance to the works of fairy tale artists from the early twentieth century such as Arthur Rackham and Edmund Dulac. Her art for Wizards of the Coast thus stands out (glaringly so, to some) when compared alongside the more common current style of fantasy art, which is more \"macho\" (influenced more by comics and artists like Frank Frazetta).

Chris O'Connor (born May 7, 1965) is a vocalist, guitarist, and bassist. His first band, I-Rails, was formed with high school buddy, guitarist/songwriter Jeff Sparks in 1986. Together with drummer Tim Lauterio, I'Rails made four albums in the course of a few years from the late 1980s up to 1991, none of which received much attention. The band officially broke-up in 1991. Using material he and Sparks wrote for a planned fifth I-Rail's album, O'Connor made the Rocket album entirely on his own on a broken-down 1969 Ampex 16-track tape deck and a budget of $1,000 and called himself Primitive Radio Gods, which is what would have been the bands last album title. The album wouldn't be released for four years however when it was picked up by Columbia Records, Germany. It was soon released with only minimal remixing and the single, \"Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand\" shot up the charts and was featured in Jim Carrey's movie The Cable Guy. O'Connor reunited with the I-Rails under the new name. The band released a second album, White Hot Peach in late 2000 under a small independent label What Are Records?, and then a third album, minus Sparks, called Still Electric in 2003. Primitive Radio Gods released their fourth full-length album, Sweet Venus, on May 4, 2006. Currently the album is only available as a download on their website. Whether or not a physical copy of the album will be produced or distributed remains to be seen. Some biographical information can be found on this page of Primitive Radio Gods' official site.

Kevin McCarthy (born February 15, 1914) is an American actor.
Mark Tansey (born 1949- in San Jose, California) is an American postmodern painter best known for monochromatic works, elaborate paintings incorporating hidden text, images and symbols and his invented \"color wheel\" approach to painting, in which a large, wooden wheel consisting of three rows of ambiguous words is spun -- the results noted for Tansey's next work's subject. Tansey's paintings normally depict everyday or historical occurrences, though they reveal certain oddities under closer scrutinization. Although Mark Tansey uses depiction of recognizable objects in realistic perspective states, he is not a \"realistic\" or rather a \"naturalistic\" painter, because photography has co-opted the role of realism in painting. He argues that representation has other functions rather than \"capturing the real. \" He argues that his work is about \"how different realities interact with each other. \" In the 1970s, influenced by the work of Rene Magritte's eight methods, he began to search for ways of displaying oppositions and contradictions as the motivation for a painting. From this he decided that illustration and representation were fundamentally necessary to heal the rift between art and practice, between symbol and meaning. He states: \"Conflict is the easiest notion [from which] to begin developing a narrative: one thing versus another. . . . crises and conflicts were results of oppositions and contradictions and these were what was necessary to activate or motivate a picture. Magritte's work also led me to wonder if this sort of conflict could take place on other levels of content, more quietly, internally, more plausibly. Could a conventional picture include many less apparent crises- the way everyday life does - without the use of overt surrealistic devices?\" The implication is that he as an artist is searching for a \"drive\" to incorporate in his subjects, that would engage the viewer intellectually, while avoiding simple visual methods and opting for a more subtle and, consequently, more sophisticated and effective approach. Most of his paintings can readily be used as examples of that approach, where at first glance nothing is out of ordinary, but then it becomes apparent that certain elements are out of context, while remaining coherent visually, thus creating the conflict. His parents are Dr. Richard Tansey, who edited several editions of Gardner's Art Through the Ages, and Luraine Tansey, an eminent slide librarian.

He made five dollars a week. He also appeared one thousand times in Broadway plays between 1924 and 1962, including The Front Page with Lee Tracy (1928). His big break came when he replaced Spencer Tracy for three weeks in the Broadway play The Last Mile. He was called to Hollywood by Darryl F. Zanuck and signed first to Paramount Pictures and shortly afterwards to Warner Bros. He originated the character of Frankie Wells in the Broadway production of Blessed Event and reprised the role in the film adaptation, both in 1932. With the advent of talking pictures, he made a career out of playing comic henchmen, stooges, policemen and other \"tough guys\" in numerous films of the 1930s and 1940s, especially for Warner Bros. He was labeled the \"greatest scene-stealer of the 1930s\" by the New York Times. He voiced the character of \"Officer Dibble\" on the Hanna Barbera TV cartoon, Top Cat and was a regular on the television situation comedy Hey, Jeannie! (1956), starring Jeannie Carson. He was also a guest star on The Red Skelton Show, I Love Lucy, Playhouse 90, The Ernie Kovacs Show, Zane Grey Theater, and The Sid Caesar Show. Eleven days before his death, he made his final appearance, at the end of Billy Wilder's 1974 film adaptation of The Front Page.

Charles Ethan Porter (c. 1847 - March 6, 1923), was an African American still life painter. Porter was born in or about 1847 in Hartford, Connecticut. His family moved to the nearby village of Rockville (now part of Vernon, Connecticut) by the early 1850s. In the 1870s, his father built a house there. He graduated from the local high school in 1865. In 1869, after two years of art study at Wesleyan Academy (now known as the Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy) in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, Porter went on to study at New York's National Academy of Design and was one of the first African Americans to exhibit at the Academy. In 1873 and 1875, he held an exhibit for the American Society of Painters in Water Color. A subsequent 1876 exhibit was at the National Academy of Design. In 1878, he opened a studio in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1879, Frederic Church commends Porter's paintings. When he traveled to Paris several years later, he took with him a letter of recommendation from Mark Twain. While in France, in 1881 he enrolled in the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs. He was in France from late 1881 to early 1884, probably also studying at times at the Academie Julian. He spent several months in the French countryside as well, including the village of Fleury, near Barbizon. Porter returned to the U.S. and opened a studio in New York City in 1885 and then returned to Hartford, where he opened a studio in 1887. He left Hartford for Rockville in 1889, where he briefly had a studio in the Fitch Block and afterward at the remains of a tower on Fox Hill, which a family member owned. In 1910, Porter become a charter member of the Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts. At times from 1890 to 1896 he also had a studio in New York City. Later, his fortunes declined, possibly because of health issues and certainly because of mounting racism nationwide, and he sold his paintings door-to-door in Rockville, Connecticut, where he died in 1923 in virtual obscurity, around the age of 75. In recent years, Porter has been rediscovered and is now remembered as the creator of minor masterpieces of American still life painting. He is most famous for fruit and floral still life.
Una O'Connor (October 23, 1880 &ndash; February 4, 1959) was an Irish actress who worked extensively in theatre before becoming a notable character actress in film.
Arthur O'Connell (March 29, 1908 &ndash; May 18, 1981) was an American stage and film actor. He appeared in films (starting with a small role in Citizen Kane) in 1941 and television programs (mostly guest appearances). Among his screen appearances were Picnic, Anatomy of a Murder, and as the watch-maker who hides Jews during WWII in The Hiding Place. A veteran vaudevillian, O'Connell, from New York City, made his legitimate stage debut in the mid 1930s, at which time he fell within the orbit of Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre. Welles cast O'Connell in the tiny role of a reporter in the closing scenes of Citizen Kane (1941), a film often referred to as O'Connell's film debut, though in fact he had already appeared in Freshman Year (1939) and had costarred in two Leon Errol short subjects as Leon's conniving brother-in-law. After numerous small movie parts, O'Connell returned to Broadway, where he appeared as the erstwhile middle-aged swain of a spinsterish schoolteacher in Picnic - a role he'd recreate in the 1956 film version, earning an Oscar nomination in the process. Later the jaded looking O'Connell was frequently cast as fortyish losers and alcoholics; in the latter capacity he appeared as James Stewart's boozy attorney mentor in Anatomy of a Murder (1959), and the result was another Oscar nomination. In 1962 O'Connell portrayed the father of Elvis Presley's character in the motion picture Follow That Dream, and in 1964 in the Presley-picture Kissin' Cousins. O'Connell continued appearing in choice character parts on both TV and films during the 1960s, but avoided a regular television series, holding out until he could be assured top billing. He appeared as Joseph Baylor in the 1964 episode \"A Little Anger Is a Good Thing\" on the ABC medical drama about psychiatry, Breaking Point. The actor accepted the part of a man who discovers that his 99-year-old father has been frozen in an iceberg on the 1967 sitcom The Second Hundred Years, assuming he'd be billed first per the producers' agreement. Instead, top billing went to newcomer Monte Markham in the dual role of O'Connell's father and his son. O'Connell accepted the demotion to second billing as well as could be expected, but he never again trusted the word of any Hollywood executive. Ill health forced O'Connell to significantly reduce his acting appearances in the mid '70s, but the actor stayed busy as a commercial spokesman, a friendly pharmacist who was a spokesperson for Crest toothpaste. At the time of his death from Alzheimer's disease in California in May 1981, O'Connell was appearing solely in these commercials, by his own choice. O'Connell was buried in Calvary Cemetery, Queens, New York.

Ted Shapiro became a member of ASCAP in 1924. His biggest hits were the holiday standard \"Winter Weather\" from 1941 and \"If I Had You\", first published in 1928, which continues to be covered by new recording artiststs and used in movie soundtracks into the 21st century. His other successful tunes and songs include \"He's Home for a Little While\", \"A Handful of Stars\", \"To You\", \"Far Away Island\", \"Sitting in the Sand A-Sunnin'\", \"Now I'm In Love\", \"\"You'll Be Reminded of Me\", \"Starlight Souvenirs\", \"This is No Dream\", \"Dog on the Piano\", \"Puttin' On the Dog\", \"Waitin' for Katy\", and \"Ask Anyone in Love\".

P. Buckley Moss was born on May 20, 1933 on Staten Island in New York City. She attended Washington Irving High School for the Fine Arts in Manhattan. In what turned out to be quite ironic in light of her later career, she was voted \"Least Likely to Succeed\" by the students of her high school. She continued on to study art at Cooper Union. Soon after graduating in 1955, she married a chemical engineer named Jack Moss. In 1964, Jack's work took Pat and her five-going-on-six children to Waynesboro, Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley. Appreciating the rural scenery, she began using it in her art. She was particularly drawn to the Amish and Mennonite people she observed across the countryside. Selling out a one-person museum exhibition in 1967, she started to market her work more seriously. The subtle stylings and calming nature of her work drew widespread acclaim, and her art garnered the interest of collectors across Europe and Japan. The P. Buckley Moss Museum opened in Waynesboro, Virginia in 1989. It has grown to attract roughly 45,000 visitors each year. In 1995, the P. Buckley Moss Foundation for Children's Education was created to aid children with learning disabilities.

Francis Gregory Di Fronzo (born November 15, 1969 in San Pedro, California, USA) is known for his strikingly realistic and ominous landscape paintings. Di Fronzo started his career as an artist in the late 1980's in Southern California under the guidance of painter, Jeffrey Carl Horn. In 1996, Di Fronzo left Southern California to study painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts where he began to develop his unique brand of landscape painting. \"I was always attracted to landscape painting ... all the notions of romance, beauty and nostalgia. These associations were nothing more than a kind of human projection. To me,the landscape was brutal, unsympathetic to human emotion and, above all else, it was savage. \" Di Fronzo's paintings exhibit a kind of simplistic beauty but also reveal a baleful look at the world. Di Fronzo was awarded a Pew Fellowship in 2004.
Luther Chase Goldman (1909-2005) was an American naturalist and wildlife photographer. Best known for his photographs of endangered species of birds, he was chief photographer of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Luther was born in Washington, D.C. , on November 2, 1909. He was fortunate in his younger years to learn nature lore from his father, Edward A. Goldman, an eminent naturalist. In teenage summer months he served as camp boy on research expeditions in Arizona, trapping and preparing specimens of mammals, his early interest, and also gaining field experience with the Predator and Rodent Control Branch of the Bureau of Biological Survey of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. At the University of Maryland he earned a degree in biological sciences and lettered as a football first-string lineman. Three years of field work followed: in Mexico (two winters) for biological investigations of wintering waterfowl, as a member of a party in Baja California to collect mountain sheep (a new subspecies), in Florida, as assistant in Dr. Arthur H. Howell\u2019s fauna research, and in Arizona for mammal research on the north rim of the Grand Canyon. In 1939, he married his college sweetheart, Mary Elizabeth (Betty) Mulligan. That year, too, was the beginning of his 20-year career as manager of national wildlife refuges at the new Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge in California. Luther\u2019s intense interest in ornithology and in wildlife photography developed early as a result of living in remote areas with poor access to good film developing and printing sources. He took up his own darkroom work and began documenting required narrative reports to the Washington D. C office with 8\u201D x 10\u201D prints. His illustrations attracted immediate attention, and copies of his photographs began to appear on the covers of Bureau reports and elsewhere. In 1941, he attended the first In Training School on Bureau procedures and activities at Patuxent Research Refuge in Laurel, Maryland. He spent months on a one-man biological reconnaissance prior to establishment of the Imperial and Havasu National Wildlife Refuges on the lower Colorado River in Arizona. Development plans for the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge were put on hold due to unstable conditions of the Sea\u2019s water table. In 1942, Luther transferred to New Mexico to manage the Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge. Along with normal refuge activities was an engineering project to change the course of the Pecos River for control of bank erosion. At night, only the bright lights of the far off German prisoner-of-war camp could be seen. Entering active duty in the U.S. Army in 1943, Luther served for three years as entomologist. Upon his return to civilian life he was offered three choices in wildlife refuge management. He seized the opportunity to research and develop the two new national wildlife refuges on the Texas-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley\u2014the 45,000-acre Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge and the 2000-acre Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge. The next 12 years (1947-59) were filled with excitement and challenges. In Wild America, co-authored with Roger Tory Peterson after their 30,000-mile birding expedition around North America, James Fisher wrote of him, \u201CLuther is one of the best field men I have ever encountered. \u201D After the aforementioned 20 years on western refuges (including Army service), Luther accepted a position in the Washington Office as assistant chief, Section of Wildlife Management in the Branch of Wildlife Refuges. He, Betty, and their son, Edward, moved to College Park, Maryland. He served on many panels and teams, including Secretary Udall\u2019s Eagle Survey Team, which resulted in new restrictions on poisoning, trapping, and aerial hunting of eagles in the U.S. Later, his abilities in wildlife photography led to his appointment as the Bureau\u2019s chief photographer and curator of the extensive photo files, for which he photographed endangered species and field activities. He received a certificate of commendation for his photography in the publication of Interior\u2019s Birds in Our Lives. Through these years, his many other biological and photographic duties included consultation on scientific matters and representing the Division of Wildlife Refuges at the Mountain Sheep Conference in Hermocillo, Mexico. In cooperation with the National Aeronautical Space Administration and the Atomic Energy Commission, Luther photographed wildlife on Amchitka Island, Alaska, to determine the effect of subterranean atomic bomb blasts on surface fauna and wildlife on the Kenai Peninsula. With Dr. Donald Aldrich and artist Bob Hines, he selected and arranged the annual showing of Duck Stamp art entries for judges\u2019 selection of the contest winner. On the U.S. -Canadian team to secure whooping crane eggs from the Northwest Territories, Canada, Luther photographed the operation from the air and on the ground and wrote an account for the Bureau publication In-Sight (40,000 copies reprinted for wide distribution). He made a second trip for team egg-pickup in 1974. With Dr. Aldrich, he made a six-year study and photographic record of the bald eagle from nestling to adult to determine its age when acquiring complete white head and tail feathers. Prior to the California condors\u2019 disappearance in the wild, in cooperation with the National Wildlife Federation, Luther photographed them in the mountains of Sespe National Sanctuary, northeast of Los Angeles. He created slide shows concerning endangered species for use by the Regional and Washington Offices, as well as on loan to the general public. His photographs have hung in the U.S. Capitol, State Department, museums in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the library of Peter Scott at Slimbridge, and are widely used in publications of the federal government and National Geographic Society and in books by conservation authors. Retiring in 1974 after 35 years of government service, he led many natural history tours, both in the National Capitol area as well as abroad, including such places as Trinidad &amp; Tobago. He was honored by both the Montgomery County Chapter of the Maryland Ornithological Society and the Prince George\u2019s County Audubon Society, highlighting the contributions he made to them and to the cause of wildlife preservation in general. He was elected to membership in the Washington Biologists\u2019 Field Club in 1960 and was chairman of Books and Photographs Committee. When The Members and History of the Washington Biologists\u2019 Field Club was revised in 1984 and the Supplement in 1993, Luther supplied the photographs, printing many from old negatives (some glass plates) and developing and printing new ones. In 1996, he was selected to become an honorary member. Luther lived with his wife, Betty. for many years in their home in College Park, Maryland, until her death in 2002. He continued to live alone and be very active with birding projects. Luther died at age 95 in Lanham, Maryland, on January 12, 2005, after a short illness. Luther was one of the most popular and active members of the Washington Biologists\u2019 Field Club and attended an oyster roast on Plummers Island on October 30, 2004, just three days before his 95th birthday.

Joseph Stella (June 13, 1877 - November 5, 1946) was an Italian-born, American Futurist painter best known for his depictions of industrial America. He is associated with the American Precisionism movement of the 1910s-1940s. He was born in Muro Lucano, Italy but came to New York City in 1896. He studied at the Art Students League of New York under William Merritt Chase. His first paintings are Rembrandtesque depictions of city slum life. In 1908, he was commissioned for a series on industrial Pittsburgh later published in The Pittsburgh Survey. It was his return to Europe in 1909, and his first contact with modernism, that would truly mold his distinctive personal style. Returning to New York in 1913, he painted Battle of Lights, Mardi Gras, Coney Island, which is one of the earliest American Futurist works. He is famous for New York Interpreted, a five-paneled work patterned after a religious altarpiece, but depicting bridges and skyscrapers instead of saints. This piece reflects the belief, common at the time, that industry was displacing religion as the center of modern life. It is currently owned by the Newark Museum. A famous Stella quote is: \"I have seen the future and it is good. We will wipe away the religions of old and start anew.\"

Werner Seligmann (March 30, 1930-November 12, 1998), was an architect, urban designer, and educator. He was born on March 30, 1930 in Germany. His father was a violinist; Seligmann inherited a lifelong taste for music and the arts in general. He family spent much of their life in Braunswieg Germany, until they were captured by the Nazis. The family was separated and Seligmann spent the latter part of the Second World War in a concentration camp. Unfortunately, his mother and sister never returned from the camps. After the camp guards abandoned their posts he was picked up by American troops, and ultimately reunited with his father, in Holland. From there he was sent to the US to live with relatives, in Groton, in upstate New York, a short distance from Cornell University in Ithaca. Seligmann received his B. Arch. degree from Cornell in 1955 and went on to do graduate study at the Technische Hochsschule in Braunschwieg, Germany in 1958-59. From there he returned to the US and taught as an Instructor at the University of Texas at Austin from 1956-58. It was there that he became part of a small group of faculty that was later nicknamed The Texas Rangers, a group that included Colin Rowe, John Shaw, Robert Slutzky and John Hejduk. After this group was dismissed from Austin Seligmann returned to Europe, where he taught as an Assistant at the Eidgenossiche Technische Hochschule, in Zurich, Switzerland from 1959-61. From 1961-74, he was an Associate Professor of Architecture at Cornell and an Associate Professor of Architecture at Harvard University. From 1976-1990 he was Dean and Professor of Architecture at Syracuse University. He was subsequently made Distinguished Professor of Architecture at Syracuse University. From 1990 to 1994 he was a Professor of Architecture at the ETH in Zurich. In 1998 he was awarded The Topaz Award in Architectural Education jointly from the ACSA and the AIA, their highest award for an architectural educator. Selgmann was named a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome (FAAR) in 1981. In 1994 he was Thomas Jefferson Visiting Professor at the University of Virginia, and held many visiting appointments in the US and abroad, including the ETH in Zurich, Kanto Gakuin University in Japan, Yale University, Harvard University, and Cornell University. In addition to serving as visiting critic, Seligmann wrote and lectured extensively on the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, and other architects and issues. Throughout his teaching career he maintained a practice and entered many competitions, including the invited competition, \u201CTopography of Terror\u201D, for Berlin, Germany in 1993. His firm, Werner Seligmann and Associates, Architects and Urban Designers, was based in Cortland, New York. Launched in 1961, the firm placed in national and international competitions and work of the firm was exhibited often both in the US and abroad. The architectural work of Werner Seligmann won two Progressive Architecture Design Awards, was illustrated on the cover of PA three times and was placed, or won, several national and international design competitions. Seligmann's work on developing housing prototypes for the New York State Urban Development Corporation in the 1970s and 1980s established his reputation in the area of housing. The Ithaca Scattered Site Housing Project (now known as Elm Street and Maple Ave) were widely exhibited and published and are included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York. Beth David Synagogue in Binghamton NY (1963) was often seen as a significant synthesis of Wright and Le Corbusier although derived from a Corbusian precedent. Seligmann also published numerous articles on the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, and modern architecture in general.

Sam Abell (born 1945 in Sylvania, Ohio) is an American photographer known for his frequent publication of photographs in National Geographic. He first worked for National Geographic in 1967, and is one of the more overtly artistic photographers among his magazine peers. Sam Abell's style of photography is documentary in the sense that his major avenue, the National Geographic magazine, is a publication of record. However, his best work is known for its transcendent qualities, starting at the documentary level yet open to interpretation on an aesthetic level. One of his favorite photographs (based on how often he mentions it when asked about his work) is of the tree viewed through a Japanese window, which graces the cover of his book Seeing Gardens. It's a documentary photograph of a tree, but due a combination of light and Abell's inclusion in his composition of roof tiles in the background, the photograph takes on the transcendent, illusory quality of a stained glass window. Abell rarely uses flash, preferring a pure relationship with light. He has said that he could be perfectly happy with his photography even if his only subject was light itself. Sam Abell's love of photography began due to the influence of his father who was a geography teacher who ran a photography club. In his book The Photographic Life, Abell mentions a photograph he made while on an outing with his father, a photograph that subsequently won a small prize in a photo contest. He credits that prize as being a major influence on the direction his life would take. Abell was the photographer and co-editor for his high school yearbook and newspaper. Abell graduated from the University of Kentucky in Lexington where he majored in English, minored in Journalism, and was the editor of the Kentuckian Yearbook. He is also a teacher, an artist and an author. Abell received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Toledo on May 10, 2009. Sam Abell's books are essential for any photographic book collector. His latest, The Life of a Photograph, completes a set of three volumes begun in 2000 with Seeing Gardens. It was followed in 2002 with The Photographic Life.

William Hart (March 31, 1823 \u2013 June 17, 1894), was a Scottish-born American landscape and cattle painter, and Hudson River School artist. His younger brother, James McDougal Hart, was also a Hudson River School artist, and the two painted similar subjects. He studied under Jules-Joseph Lefebvre.
James McDougal Hart (May 10, 1828 &ndash; October 24, 1901), was a Scottish-born American landscape and cattle painter of the Hudson River School. His older brother, William Hart, was also a Hudson River School artist, and the two painted similar subjects. Hart was born in Kilmarnock, Scotland, and was taken to America with his family in early youth. In Albany, New York he trained with a sign and carriage maker\u2014possibly the same employer that had taken on his brother in his early career. Unlike his brother, however, James returned to Europe for serious artistic training. He studied in Munich, and was a pupil of Friedrich Wilhelm Schirmer in D\u00FCsseldorf. Hart returned to America in 1853. He exhibited his first work at the National Academy of Design in 1848, became an associate in 1857 and a full member in 1859. James Hart was particularly devoted to the National Academy, exhibiting there over a period of more than forty years, and serving as vice president late in his life from 1895 to 1899. Like his brother, James also exhibited at the Brooklyn Art Association (he lived for a time in Brooklyn) and at major exhibitions around the country. Along with most of the major landscape artists of the time, Hart based his operations in New York City and adopted the style of the Hudson River School. While James Hart and his brother William often painted similar landscape subjects, James may have been more inclined to paint exceptionally large works. An example is The Old Homestead (1862), 42 x 68 inches, in the collection of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia. James may have been exposed to large paintings while studying in Dusseldorf, a center of realist art pedagogy that also shaped the practices of Albert Bierstadt and Worthington Whittredge. William Hart, who did not seek academic European training, seems to have been more comfortable painting small and mid-sized works. Like his brother William, James excelled at painting cattle. Kevin J. Avery writes, \"the bovine subjects that once distinguished [his works] now seem the embodiment of Hart's artistic complacency. \" In contrast with the complacency of some of his cattle scenes, his major landscape paintings are considered important works of the Hudson River School. A particularly fine example is Summer in the Catskills, now in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid, Spain. James Hart was survived by two daughters, both figure painters, Letitia B Hart (b. 1867) and Mary Theresa Hart (b.1872).

The last of these has become a Christmas season standard in the United States and around the English-speaking world and is widely considered one of the greatest Christmas songs of all-time. Martin became a close friend of Garland and was her accompanist at many of her concert performances in the 1950s including her legendary stint at the Palace.

Fuller Potter (was an American Abstract expressionist artist. He was born in New York City in 1910, attended St. Bernard's School in New York and Groton School in Groton, Massachusetts, and lived most of his life in his Ledyard, Connecticut estate, near Old Mystic. Potter started painting in the traditional modes of representation, specializing in still life and landscape. His work was shown in New York in the 1930s at the Marie Harriman Gallery Fuller Potter spent several of his formative years painting landscapes and portraits in the Southern Appalachia region, later studying painting in Paris with Andre Lhote from 1929 to 1931, and in New York with Walt Kuhn and with Thomas Hart Benton. In 1950, Potter met Jackson Pollock and changed his mode of painting permanently to abstraction, and had a number of shows of that body of work at the Mystic Gallery in Mystic, Connecticut. When starting his transition towards abstract painting, he combined his graphic skills with his mastery of color, and followed a path that would lead to his artistic peak, during his full abstract expressionist period. Several of his works can be seen at www. best-of-fuller-potter-paintings. com. During the 1940s, Potter's work was still mostly figurative, but showed deliberate avoidance of ordinary representation. From the early 1950s on, Potter's style kept with the early works of Ad Reinhardt and with Jackson Pollock's 1940's pre-drip works. He painted in the 'New York School' style, along with several of his contemporaries, including Franz Kline, Joan Mitchell, Jean-Paul Riopelle, William Baziotes, and Jackson Pollock . He had a few shows in that style at several New England Art venues. The Museum of the City of New York exhibited Fuller Potter's work along with Joan Mir\u00F3 and Georgia O'Keeffe in the main lobby, in 1959. Jeffrey Potter's To a Violent Grave, a biography of Jackson Pollock's last years, reports that Fuller Potter shared drinking sessions with Jackson Pollock in the mid-1950s. After these encounters, which occupied only a short period of his life, Fuller's work evolved towards a mature and personal form of abstraction. Potter never pursued the drip/throw action mode of abstract expressionism to any notable degree. His paint is delivered with loaded brush in hand, opulently, generously and aggressively. Fuller Potter is considered as one of the major abstract painters of the 20th Century. He died of emphysema in May 1990 at Westerly Hospital in Westerly, R.I. He was 80 years old. He is survived by three sons, Daniel Otis of Stonington, Conn. , Paul, of Washington, and Benjamin C.J. of Marion, N.C. ; a daughter, Mary Barton Goodman of Morristown, Tenn. ; a sister, Polly Balding of Camden, S.C. , and two brothers, Charles, of Chicago, and Jeffrey, of East Hampton, L.I.

He played college football at the University of Tennessee under legendary head coach Robert Neyland. He is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Atkins was a fierce defender who was known for using his immense size and agility to his advantage. At 6'8\", Atkins would often bat passes down at the line of scrimmage and would use his skills as a high jump champion to leapfrog blockers and get to the quarterback. Atkins was one of the first great exclusively defensive players in professional football and, along with fellow Hall of Famer Gino Marchetti, revolutionized the defensive end position.
Robert William Vonnoh (September 17, 1858 &ndash; 1933) was an American Impressionist painter known for his portraits and landscapes. He traveled extensively between the East Coast and France, more specifically the artists colony Grez-sur-Loing. He studied in Paris at the Academie Julian under Gustave Boulanger and Jules Joseph Lefebvre. He taught at the Cowles Art School in Boston (1884-1885), at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1883-1887), and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1891-1896). Vonnoh became a member of the National Academy of Design in 1906. His most well-known work In Flanders Field (also known as Where Soldiers Sleep and Poppies Grow or Coquelicots) was painted in 1890 in the fields of Grez-sur-Loing. This large oil on canvas, 59 x 104 inches, employed active and expressive brushstrokes to evoke the fiery cadmium red of poppies, a subject matter that was popular during that time among many painters. A young woman sits in the foreground, settling down to pick poppies in a vast field with two figures in the background. Although this was considered Vonnoh's most ambitious work, garnering great acclaim at fairs and exhibits, the painting never sold. It was not until 1919 when it was purchased directly by Joseph G. Butler, founder of The Butler Institute of American Art that In Flanders Field would find a permanent home. The painting is part of the permanent collection to this day in Youngstown, Ohio. His wife Bessie Potter Vonnoh (1872-1955) was a sculptor.

The Ten American Painters, generally known as The Ten, resigned from the Society of American Artists in late 1897 to protest the politicalization and commercialism of that group's exhibitions, and their circus-like atmosphere. The Society itself had broken away from the National Academy of Design twenty years early, also as a progressive movement, led by Thomas Eakins, Mary Cassatt, John Singer Sargent, James McNeill Whistler, and Winslow Homer. The Ten were Childe Hassam, J. Alden Weir, John Henry Twachtman, Robert Reid, Willard Metcalf, Frank Weston Benson, Edmund Charles Tarbell, Thomas Wilmer Dewing, Joseph DeCamp, and Edward Simmons. Abbott Handerson Thayer and Winslow Homer were asked to join the group when it was formed; however, they refused. When Twachtman died in 1902, William Merritt Chase joined in his place. All of The Ten were active in either New York City or Boston. They were generally considered exponents of Impressionism and established in their careers. In their charter, they agreed to resign from the Society, and hold their own annual exhibition, protesting the Society\u2019s perceived emphasis on \u201Ctoo much business and too little art. \u201D The Society for its part, claimed it was \u201Cliberal\u201D with dissenters but some members felt it should stand for \u201Ctraditional art\u201D and not vacillate with each passing art movement, and thereby let dissenters leave rather than try to appease them. The Ten held their own annual exhibitions for twenty years, and eventually fell apart from deaths among the members and as their art was deemed reactionary in comparison with urban Realism and other movements which came to the public\u2019s attention.
Reuben Bloom (April 24, 1902, New York City \u2013 March 30, 1976, New York City) was a Jewish American composer of popular songs.

During his career, he worked with many well-known performers, including Bix Beiderbecke, Ruth Etting, and Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. He collaborated with a wide number of lyricists, including Johnny Mercer, Ted Koehler, and Mitchell Parish. During the 20s he wrote many novelty piano solos which are still well regarded today. He recorded for the Aeolian Company's Duo-Art reproducing piano system various titles including his \"Spring Fever\". His first hit came in 1927 with \"Soliloquy\"; his last was \"Here's to My Lady\" in 1952, which he wrote with Johnny Mercer. Bloom formed and led a number of bands during his career, such as Rube Bloom and His Bayou Boys (which was used on 3 sessions in 1930; totally 6 of the hottest recordings made in the first days of the depression, an all-star studio group containing Benny Goodman, Adrian Rollini, Tommy Dorsey and Manny Klein). At other times, he played with other bands; an example of this side of his career can be found in his work with Bix Beiderbecke and Frankie Trumbauer in the Sioux City Six. His song \"I Can't Face the Music\" was recorded by Ella Fitzgerald on her 1962 Verve release Rhythm is My Business, in a fabulous swing/big band version with Bill Doggett. According to some sources, his first name was pronounced like 'Ruby' by his friends.
Toby Robins was a noted Canadian actress]] Toby Robins was born 13th March, 1931. She starred in hundreds of radio and stage productions in Canada from the late 1940s through the 1960s, working with such stars as Jane Mallett, Barry Morse, John Drainie, Ruth Springford, James Doohan, and many others. She appeared in a number of television and film roles beginning in the mid-1950s, and hosted the first-ever CBC Television series, The Big Revue in 1952. She starred at the Stratford Festival opposite Christopher Plummer in 'Cyrano de Bergerac'. She also had leading parts in 'Measure for Measure' with James Mason and other plays with the likes of William Shatner. In Toronto she played in repertory with Lorne Greene, Mavor Moore, Don Harron. This was in a company founded by Dora Mavor Moore, as well as playing Peter Pan for Dora. She also appeared with Eli Wallach. At the Crest Theatre she played the leading parts in 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof', 'Dream Girl' and many others. Robins became a popular television personality as an original member of the cast of the long-running CBC television series Front Page Challenge in 1957, remaining with the program until 1961. Originally hosted by Alex Barris and later Fred Davis, Front Page Challenge was a current events series disguised as a panel-style game show in a similar format to the American What's My Line?. Panelists had to guess the news story or person behind a news story by asking questions of the guest; after the game portion, the guest was then interviewed informally by the panel. Although Robins was initially criticized for asking simple and sometimes unintelligent questions, she soon found her journalistic sea legs and before long was holding her own alongside the more experienced journalists, including her co-panellists Gordon Sinclair and Pierre Berton. She was asked to run for Parliament by Lester Pearson and always joked that she probably would have been elected. She left the series in a salary dispute in 1961 and was replaced by future senator Betty Kennedy (who remained with the show until its demise in the 1990s). Robins returned to the show from time to time as a guest panellist. Alex Barris, in his book Front Page Challenge: the 25th Anniversary (CBC Books, 1981) relates that Robins became a major celebrity in Canada during her time on the series, to the extent that she was seen to be influential for appearing on the show while pregnant, and received angry letters (including a death threat) when she covered her trademark brunette hair with a blonde wig for a few shows. In Knowlton Nash's book about the origins of the CBC he said, 'Toby Robins was quite simply the most beautiful woman to star on Canadian television. ' In 1964 Robins relocated to London and she appeared in a number of film and television productions, including ' (the two-parter \"The Bringers of Wonder\", which was later re-issued as the telefilm Destination Moonbase Alpha) and in 1981 she played Melina Havelock's ill-fated mother in the James Bond film For Your Eyes Only. On the London Stage Robins played star parts in two plays at the Royal Shakespeare Company: 'The Relapse' and 'The Latent Heterosexual'; 'Flip Side', 'Aspern Papers' with Vanessa Redgrave and Christopher Reeve. Among other outstanding things she did was the film 'The Naked Runner' with Frank Sinatra and a Noel Coward double bill on television with Paul Scofield. Robins died from breast cancer, aged 55, in 1986. In 1991, her family founded the Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Centre in London, which was opened in 1999 by HRH The Prince of Wales, with the aim of producing a coordinated program of research to tackle breast cancer. It is the first dedicated breast cancer research centre in the United Kingdom, and directly linked to one of the most renowned cancer facilities in the world, the Royal Marsden Hospital.
Joseph Rodefer DeCamp (November 5, 1858 - February 11, 1923) was an American painter. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, he studied with Frank Duveneck in that city. In the second half of the 1870s he went with Duveneck and fellow students to the Royal Academy of Munich, then spent time in Florence, Italy, returning to Boston in 1883. He became known as a member of the Boston school led by Edmund Charles Tarbell and Emil Otto Grundmann, focusing on figure painting, and in the 1890s adopting the style of Tonalism. He was a founder of the Ten American Painters, a group of American Impressionists, in 1897.

Maurits Frederik Hendrik de Haas (December 12, 1832 &ndash; November 23, 1895) was a Dutch-American marine painter. His name has been written as Mauritz Frederik de Haas, Maurice F. H. de Haas, Maurice Frederic Henri de Haas, Mauritz Frederick Hendrick De Haas, \"Maurice Frederick Hendrick de Haas\", as well as various other variations. De Haas was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands. He studied art in the Rotterdam Academy and at The Hague, under Johannes Bosboom and Louis Meyer, and in 1851-1852 in London, following the English watercolourists of the day. In 1857 he received an artists commission in the Dutch Navy, but in 1859, under the patronage of August Belmont, who had recently been minister of the United States at The Hague, he resigned and moved to New York City. He became an associate of the National Academy in 1863 and an academician in 1867, and exhibited annually in the academy, and in 1866 he was one of the founders of the American Society of Painters in Water Colors. He died in New York City. His Farragut Passing the Forts at the Battle of New Orleans and The Rapids above Niagara, which were exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1878, were his best known but not his most typical works, for his favorite subjects were storm and wreck, wind and heavy surf, and less often moonlight on the coasts of Holland, of Jersey, of New England, Long Island, the English Channel and of Grand Manan island in the Bay of Fundy. His brother Willem Frederik de Haas (1830-1880) was also a marine painter.

After opening an office in Los Angeles that year, he became associated with Daniel Hull of the National Park Service. This led to a commission with the Utah Parks Company of the Union Pacific Railroad which was developing the parks in hopes of producing destinations for travelers. During this time Underwood designed lodges for Cedar Breaks National Monument, Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, and North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park. In addition, he was contracted to design Yosemite National Park's Ahwahnee Hotel, probably his greatest triumph in the rustic style. Underwood also designed stations for the Union Pacific, culminating in the art deco style station in Omaha in 1929. Then in 1932, Underwood joined the Federal Architects Project. While working for the federal government, Underwood produced the preliminary designs for the Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood, Oregon, and went on to design more than 20 post offices, two major federal buildings, and the U.S. State Department Building. From 1947 to 1949, he was appointed as federal supervisory architect. Following retirement and utilizing an association with John D. Rockefeller, Jr. , and the Williamsburg Lodge project in Virginia, Underwood designed as his last major commission the Jackson Lake Lodge (1950-1954), Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming.

For entries on other people named John Wesley, see John Wesley (disambiguation). John Wesley Jarvis (1781? - January 14, 1839), American painter, nephew of Methodist leader John Wesley, was born at South Shields, England, and was taken to the United States at the age of five. He was one of the earliest American painters to give serious attention to the study of anatomy. He lived at first in Philadelphia, afterwards establishing himself in New York City, where he enjoyed great popularity, though his conviviality and eccentric mode of life affected his work. He visited Baltimore, Charleston, and New Orleans, entertaining much and painting portraits of prominent people, particularly in New Orleans, where General Andrew Jackson was one of his sitters. He had for assistants at different times both Thomas Sully and Henry Inman. He affected singularity in dress and manners, and his mots were the talk of the day. But his work deteriorated, and he died in great poverty in New York City. Examples of his painting are in the collections of the New York Historical Society and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Father Patrick Francis Healy (February 27, 1830 \u2013 January 10, 1910) was the first African American to earn a PhD, the first to become a Jesuit priest, and the first to become president of a major university in the United States. Patrick, as he was known, was born in Macon, Georgia to Irish-American plantation owner Michael Healy, of the Healy family of Georgia, and bi-racial slave Mary Eliza. His brothers James and Michael also achieved notable firsts for African Americans during the second half of the 19th century. Patrick was the third son of Mary Eliza and Michael Morris Healy, who joined in a common law marriage in 1829. Mary was a slave and Michael was an Irish slave owner. After Patrick's father Michael bought his mother, he fell in love with her and made her his wife. Due to dicriminatory laws in Georgia, he arranged for his children to leave Georgia and move to the North to obtain their educations. Healy sent his older sons first to a Quaker school in Flushing, New York. Despite the Quaker's emphasis on equality, Patrick met some discrimination throughout his grade school years, not only because of his race, but also his Irish heritage and the fact that his father owned slaves, which the Quakers considered unforgivable. When Michael Healy heard of a new Jesuit college, the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, he sent his four oldest sons, including Patrick, to study there in 1844. They were joined at Holy Cross by their younger brother Michael in 1849. Following Patrick's graduation in 1850, he entered the Jesuit order and continued his studies. He was sent to Europe to study in 1858, as his \"race\" had become an issue in the United States. He attended University of Leuven in Belgium, earning his doctorate, becoming the first American of openly acknowledged part-African descent to do so. During this period he was also ordained to the priesthood on September 3, 1864. In 1866 he returned to the United States and taught philosophy at Georgetown University. Eight years later, in 1874, he became its twenty-ninth president. Patrick Healy's influence on Georgetown was so far-reaching that he is often referred to as the school's \"second founder,\" following Archbishop John Carroll. Healy helped transform the small nineteenth century college into a major university for the twentieth century. He modernized the curriculum by requiring courses in the sciences, particularly chemistry and physics. He expanded and upgraded the schools of law and medicine. He also broke the color barrier in Catholic education by becoming one of the most world renowned black Jesuit priests of his time. The most visible result of Healy's presidency was the construction of a large building begun in 1877 and first used in 1881, a building named in his honor as Healy Hall. Healy left the College in 1882 and travelled extensively through the United States and Europe often in the company of his brother James, later returning in 1908 to the campus infirmary where he died. He is buried on the grounds of the University in the Jesuit cemetery.
Joan Weber (December 12, 1935 - May 13, 1981) was an American popular music singer. Weber was raised in Paulsboro, New Jersey, and married to a young bandleader. She was pregnant in 1954 when she was introduced to Eddie Joy, a manager, who in turn introduced her to Charles Randolph Grean, an A&amp;R worker for RCA and Dot Records in New York. Grean gave a demo of Weber's singing a song called \"Marionette\" to Mitch Miller, the head of A&amp;R at Columbia Records. Miller took a song entitled \"Let Me Go, Devil\" and had it rewritten by Jenny Lou Carson and Al Hill as \"Let Me Go, Lover!\" for Weber, who recorded it on the Columbia label. The song was performed on the television show, Studio One and caught the public's fancy, reaching #1 in the United States and #16 in the United Kingdom in 1955. At the time of the song's biggest success, however, she gave birth to a baby daughter Terry Lynn, and was unable to promote her career. Others have suggested that Mitch Miller simply was not interested enough in Weber to invest the money in her she needed to continue her career. Consequently the song was the only recording of hers to chart, and she was dropped from Columbia's roster. Weber died of heart failure at a mental institution in Ancora, New Jersey, aged 45.

He received a third-class medal in Paris in 1840, and one of the second class in 1855, when he exhibited his \"Franklin urging the claims of the American Colonies before Louis XVI. \" Among his portraits of eminent men are those of Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, John Calhoun, Arnold Henry Guyot, William H. Seward, Louis Philippe, and the presidents of the United States from J. Q. Adams to Ulysses Grant--this series being painted for the Corcoran Gallery, Washington, D.C.. Healy also painted a very famous presidential portrait of Abraham Lincoln in 1877. This painting was based on his 1868 painting The Peacemakers. His father was an Irish captain in the merchant marine, and \"the Celtic strain ran bright and lovable through the temperament of the son' (Isham). The eldest of five children, Healy, early left fatherless, helped to support his mother. When sixteen years of age he began drawing, and at once fired with the ambition to be an artist. Miss Stuart, daughter of the American painter, aided him in every way, loaned him a Guido's \"Ecce Homo\", which he copied in colour and sold to a country priest. Later, she introduced him to Sully, by whose advice Healy profited much, and gratefully repaid Sully in the days of the latter's adversity. At eighteen, Healy began painting portraits, and was soon very successful. In 1834, he went to Europe, leaving his mother well provided for, and remained abroad sixteen years during which he studied with Baron Gros, came under the pervading influence of Couture, painted assiduously, and won (1840) a third class medal in the Salon. His Franklin urging the Claims of the Colonists before Louis XVI gained him a second-class gold medal at the Paris International Exhibition of 1855. This year, also, saw him in Chicago, where he remained until 1869, when he again visited the Continent, painting steadily, chiefly in Rome and Paris, for twenty-one years. His final return to Chicago was in 1892. Healy painted more portraits than any other American artist, and of more eminent men than any other artist in the world. Among his sitters were Pius IX (1871), Lincoln, Grant (1878) Cardinal McCloskey, Louis Philippe (\"his royal patron\"), Marshal Soult, Webster, Calhoun, Hawthorne, Prescott, Longfellow, Liszt, Gambetta, Thiers, Lord Lyons, and the Princess (now the queen) of Rumania. In one large historical work, \"Webster's Reply to Hayne\" (1851), now in Faneuil Hall, Boston, there are one hundred and thirty portraits. Healy was remarkably facile, enterprising, courageous, and industrious. \"All my days are spent in my painting room\" (Reminiscences). His style, essentially French, was sound, his colour fine, his drawing correct and his management of light and shade excellent. His likenesses, firm in outline, solidly painted, and with later glazings, are emphatic, rugged, and forceful. Healy was an honorary member of the National Academy of Design and wrote a delightful book: \"Reminiscences of a Portrait Painter\". Among his principal works are portraits of: Lincoln (Corcoran Gallery), Bishop (later Cardinal) McClosky (bishop's residence, Albany), Guizot (1841, in Smithsonian Institution), Audubon (1838, Boston Soc. Nat. Hist. ), Comte de Paris (Met. Mus. Of Art, New York), Isaac Thomas Hecker C.S.P. , Founder of the Paulist Fathers (North American Paulist Center, Washington, D.C.).

The university's Jordan-Hare Stadium is named in his honor. Jordan was named National Coach of the Year in 1957 when Auburn was voted national champions by the Associated Press.

A 1932 graduate of Auburn, he lettered in football, baseball, and basketball while there and was voted the Most Outstanding Athlete in 1932. He was a member of Theta Chi Fraternity. After graduation, he became the head basketball coach, and an assistant football coach at Auburn. In ten seasons (1934-42, 1945-1946) as the head basketball coach, he compiled a record of 95-77.

Jordan would lead Auburn to its first SEC championship and its first, and only national championship in 1957. In 1971, Jordan's tutelage led quarterback Pat Sullivan to the Heisman Trophy. However, his Heisman season ended in disappointment with a convincing loss to the Oklahoma Sooners in the Sugar Bowl. The next year, Jordan's Tigers upset heavily-favored, arch-rival Alabama in the Iron Bowl - a victory which became known by the nickname Punt Bama Punt. In 1973, the university renamed Cliff Hare Stadium to Jordan-Hare Stadium in his honor making it the first stadium in the U.S. to be named for an active coach. When Jordan retired after the 1975 season he had amassed an enviable record of 176-83-6 for a .675 percentage and 22 winning seasons out of the 25 he had coached.
Robert Sarmast is a Persian American architect who claims to have found the legendary city of Atlantis on November 14, 2004, saying that by using sonar scans he was able to find man-made walls that matched Plato's description of the structures. The site lies 1,500 meters deep in the Mediterranean Sea between Cyprus and Syria. Sarmast's theory is that Cyprus was once a larger island, connected to the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea by a land bridge, and that Atlantis was on the part of Cyprus that is now beneath the Mediterranean. He believes that Atlantis and the Garden of Eden are one and the same. Sarmast's research over the last fifteen years targeted the location of Atlantis, and his evidence was first reported in his book \"Discovery of Atlantis: The Startling Case for the Island of Cyprus. \" The book has since been revised and translated to Greek and Turkish. It has been suggested that he is influenced by the Urantia Book. In 2004 he founded First Source Enterprises, LLC, to promote more extensive research near Cyprus, which led to the world's first scientific Atlantis expedition. As the president of First Source Enterprises, LLC, Sarmast has secured three research grants from the government of Cyprus and was awarded the prestigious \"International Artiglio Award\" by Rotary International, given to individuals who have distinguished themselves for their commitment in the development of science and technology.

Jon Jerde (b.1940) is an American architect based in Venice, California, Founder &amp; Chairman of The Jerde Partnership, a design architecture and urban planning firm that pioneered the concept of placemaking and \"experience architecture;\" and has created multiple award-winning commercial developments around the globe. Jerde has grown into a multi-disciplinary firm with offices in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul, Amsterdam, and Dubai. The firm is sought after for its ability to create destinations and memorable experiences for people that attract millions of visitors through its innovative design and planning approach. To date, nearly 1 billion people visit Jerde-designed places each year. Jon is also a graduate of the School of Architecture at the University of Southern California. After early years working at Charles Kober Associates on multiple retail projects, including Plaza Pasadena, Jerde was commissioned by developer Ernie Hahn for the design of Horton Plaza, across from Horton Plaza Park in downtown San Diego. The project is credited by some with single-handedly rejuvenating the city's downtown core by replacing several blocks of older structures with a new retail village concept. The design was a radical departure from traditional suburban mall design of the time. It is a five story outdoor retail complex, with the main passage being diagonally oriented to the street grid and at the time anchored by Nordstrom, Macy's, and a Sam Goody music store; and connected to a Westin Hotel and the Balboa Theatre, resulting in an urban mixed-use center. Its spatial rhythms include long one-way ramps and sudden drop-offs, dramatic parapets, shadowy colonnades and cul-de-sacs, and the design shattered many traditional mall-design rules such as lowering ambient arousal levels and protecting the maximal lines-of-sight to merchandise. Its fragmented spaces look and feel more like a postmodern art project than a traditional mall, and its festive colors were a contrast to the ubiquitous beige store architecture of the period. The project was completed in 1985. Despite the unique and non-traditional retail design approach, Horton Plaza's radical design brought 25 million visitors in the first year, and as of 2004 continued to generate San Diego's highest sales per unit area. The project also sparked nearly $2.4 billion in redevelopment to the surrounding area and downtown core. Westfield currently owns Horton Plaza and is in the process of developing a series of expansions. The Jerde Partnership also developed its placemaking and experiential philosophy with the design and planning of the Los Angeles 1984 Olympics, which became the only profitable Olympics to date. Based on the success of both Horton (from a retailing perspective), and the Olympics (from a placemaking concept), the firm continued to evolve is creative expertise in creating retail and entertainment destinations, designing the redevelopment of Fashion Island in Newport Beach, CA in 1989; the hugely successful $680M Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota in 1992, the original Urban Entertainment Center Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles; the pirate show and facade of the Treasure Island Casino in Vegas in 1993; the Las Vegas Fremont Street Experience in 1995; and Bellagio in Las Vegas in 1998. The firm developed into a major international company with key urban regeneration projects overseas, including Beursplein in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and Canal City Hakata in Fukuoka, Japan, both in 1996, as well as significant other projects in Japan, China, and Europe. Jerde has continued to evolve its design expertise and more recently has completed a string of critically acclaimed urban mixed-use, sustainable developments, including: Namba Parks in Osaka, Japan, recently awarded the Urban Land Institute Awards of Excellence: Asia Pacific, 2009; Roppongi Hills in Tokyo, Japan; Kanyon in Istanbul, Turkey; and Zlote Tarasy in Warsaw, Poland; along with multiple high profile projects currently in the design and planning stages. Jerde's projects are consistently marked by three things: a respect for user experience unique among American architecture firms, a lasting sense of clarity and entertainment in the final environment, and a very high rate of return - both economically and socially. In the first 20 days of operation, the Las Vegas hotel/casino Bellagio that Jerde designed for Steve Wynn achieved an impressive annualized sales of $1800 per square foot ($19,000/m\u00B2), an astonishing feat for even Vegas standards, particularly at a time when gaming revenues far exceeded non-gaming functions. In the architectural and development community, Jerde has received numerous awards for its projects and accomplishments over the past three decades. The Jerde Partnership continues to design around the world as a mutli-national design studio, currently working on projects in China, Korea, Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe, the UAE, and Los Angeles. Jon Jerde, FAIA serves as Chairman of the firm and Rick Poulos, AIA, is Executive Vice President and Partner-in-charge. The design is overseen by Jon Jerde and led by the firms three Design Directors: John Simones (Partner), David Rogers, AIA (Partner), and Tammy McKerrow (Partner).

James Gamble Rogers (March 3, 1867 &mdash; October 1, 1947) was an American architect best known for his academic commissions at Yale University, Columbia University, Northwestern University, and elsewhere. Rogers was born in Bryan Station, Kentucky, to James M. and Katharine Gamble Rogers. Rogers attended Yale University, where he was a member of Scroll and Key, a senior society whose membership included several other notable architects. He received his B.A. in 1889, and is responsible for many of the gothic revival structures at Yale University built in the 1910s through the mid 1930s, as well as the university's master plan in 1924. He designed for other universities as well, such as the Butler Library at Columbia University, many of the original buildings at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, and several structures at Northwestern University. Rogers was philanthropist Edward Harkness's favorite architect, and Harkness would often condition a gift for a new academic or medical building upon the institution's agreement to hire Rogers for the project. It is thus no coincidence that Rogers' work is abundant at Yale, Columbia and the other institutions Harkness supported lavishly. Though Harkness loved Rogers's work, when Harkness donated a new home for Wolf's Head, his society at Yale, another architect was chosen, for obvious reasons, according to many sources in architectural histories. Rogers' neo-Gothic designs for Yale lent an air of instant heritage and authenticity to the campus. Rogers was criticized by other prominent Gothic-revival Ameican architects, namely Ralph Adams Cram, for his use of steel frames underneath stone cladding, and tricks such as splashing acid on stone walls to simulate age. Rogers was also criticized by the growing Modernist movement of the time. The 1927 Sterling Memorial Library came under especially vocal attack from Yale students for its historicist spirit and its lavish use of ornament. Rogers's nephew, James Gamble Rogers II (1901-1990) was also an architect, who designed homes in Winter Park, Florida for the Rogers family architecture firm Rogers, Lovelock and Fritz, where Rogers II's son John (Jack) Rogers is a principal architect. Rogers II's other son, James Gamble Rogers IV (1937-1991) was also trained as an architect. After working in the family firm as a young man, James Gamble Rogers IV decided to pursue his passion for music. He became a noted Florida folksinger, composer and guitarist, now memorialized by the Gamble Rogers Memorial Foundation, Gamble Rogers Middle School, and Gamble Rogers Memorial State Recreation Area at Flagler Beach on Florida's east coast. James Gamble Rogers' architectural drawings and photographs are now held in the Dept. of Drawings &amp; Archives in the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University in New York.

James Alan Bland (12 October 1854 \u2013 5 May 1911), also known as Jimmy Bland, was an African American musician and song writer. He was one of 8 children born in Flushing, New York to a free family. His father was one of the first U. S. Negro college graduates. Because white men in blackface dominated the field of U. S. minstrel shows, Bland did not get very far in his U. S. minstrel career before the abolition of slavery in the United States. Beginning with an eight-dollar banjo purchased by his father, he was performing professionally by age 14. Bland was educated in Washington, DC and graduated from Howard University in 1873. He wrote over 700 songs, including \"In the Evening by the Moonlight,\" \"O Dem Golden Slippers\" (the theme song for the long running Philadelphia Mummers Parade) and \"Carry Me Back to Old Virginny\", published in 1878, which, in a slightly modified form, was the official State Song of Virginia from 1940-1997. Often called \"The World's Greatest Minstrel Man\", Bland toured the United States, as well as Europe. Beginning in 1881, he spent 20 years in London before returning to the United States. Bland toured Europe in the early 1880s with Haverly's Genuine Colored Minstrels and remained in England to perform as a singer/banjo player without blackface. Appearing as \"The Prince of Negro Songwriters,\" he was invited to give command performances for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales, and that after Stephen Foster, Bland is \"the most distinguished creator of sentimental songs about the Negro and the South\" and the \"first major black popular song composer\" to emerge from the black minstrel show. Music historian Eric Wilder calls Bland the black writer who \"broke down the barriers to white music publishers' offices. \" James A. Bland spent his later years in obscurity. He died from tuberculosis May 5, 1911 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Some sources give a death date of May 6, 1911. ) Bland was buried in an unmarked grave without a funeral at Merion Memorial Park, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. In 1939 his grave was found by American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (A.S.C.A.P. ) with the assistance of the editor of \"The Etude\" Magazine, James Francis Cooke. His grave was landscaped and a monument was erected. The Lions Club of Virginia also assisted in this effort. The Lions Clubs of Virginia sponsor a music contest for school students called the \"Bland Contest\" in honor of James A. Bland. The Annual Bland Music Scholarships Program was established in 1948 to assist and promote cultural and educational opportunities for the musically talented youth of Virginia. James Bland was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. A housing project in Flushing, Queens is named after him.

Emerson Stewart Williams, FAIA (1909&ndash;September 10, 2005) was a prolific Palm Springs, California-based architect whose distinctive modernist style buildings significantly shaped the Coachella Valley's architectural landscape. E. Stewart Williams's father, Harry Williams, was a well-respected architect originally based in Dayton, Ohio best known for designing the offices of National Cash Register. In 1934 Julia Carnell, whose husband was the comptroller of NCR, decided that a commercial development in Palm Springs, where she wintered, would be a good investment and brought Harry Williams to Palm Springs to design the historic La Plaza Shopping Center. Harry Williams stayed on in the city afterward, opening his own architectural practice, which was later joined by E. Stewart's younger brother, Roger, also an architect. Williams completed his undergraduate studies at Cornell University in 1932 and was elected to the Sphinx Head Society. Williams then taught at Columbia University from 1934 to 1938. In 1938 Williams traveled through northern Europe and he met and married a Swedish woman on the trip. Upon returning he worked in Raymond Loewy's office. In Loewy's office Williams' responsibilities included projects for the 1939 New York World's Fair, and the Lord and Taylor department store in Manhasset, Long Island in 1941, one of the first large suburban department stores to be built. In 1941 Williams began working in his father's Dayton office on defense-related projects. By 1943 Williams was involved in the building of ships at the Bechtel Marin facility in Sausalito followed by a stint at Mare Island with the Navy. In 1946 Williams joined his father and brother in their Palm Springs practice, forming Williams, Williams, &amp; Williams. Williams's first residential commission was a house for Frank Sinatra. Williams says that on May 1, 1947 Sinatra wandered into their office eating an ice cream cone and stating that he wanted a house built by Christmas, meaning Williams had roughly only three months to design it and another three months to build it. Sinatra's other requirement was that it be a Georgian-style mansion, a style neither aesthetically nor functionally suited to the desert. Williams ended up presenting Sinatra two designs, one in the style he requested, and the other a low-lying, modern design, well integrated into the surrounding landscape and functionally appropriate to the climate. Luckily for all Sinatra chose the latter. Though a relatively conservative design in comparison to the works of other notable architects then building in the area, particularly Richard Neutra and Albert Frey, the house would become an architectural trend-setter (being the first \"shed roof\" house in the desert) and serve as model of \"hipness\" in the desert community, thought this was perhaps as much due to its occupant as to its design. Roger Williams in a much later interview spoke about Sinatra's final choice of a modern design: \"I'm so glad. We'd (Williams, Williams, &amp; Williams) have been ruined if we'd been forced to build Georgian in the desert. \" What followed were an unbroken string of commissions, large and small, institutional and private, commercial and residential that made the practice of Williams, Williams, &amp; Williams, and in particular E. Stewart Williams, one those most fecund practices and architects in the region. Williams' father died in 1957, and John Porter Clark joined the practice in the 1960s. Among those significant commissions was one for a house for the Seattle hotel owners William and Marjorie Edris. Having purchased a large lot, the Edris' commissioned Williams as both the architect and the contractor for the job. Williams' design was more sophisticated and integrated into its desert surroundings than the earlier Sinatra house. The Edris House, as it is now known, remains largely unchanged, containing many of the original Williams' designed fixtures and details, and is protected from alteration by being designated a historic building by the Palm Springs City Council in 2004.

In 1987 he was commissioned by the Korean Olympic Committee to be the KOC's official artist for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Several of those images were reproduced in a series of limited editions prints as well.

Most recently Forbes has done a number of mural-size paintings for a number of clients including legendary golf moments for the TCP Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra, FL. He has also become interested in experimenting with Sill Life and landscape paintings which are reproduced as Giclees.

James O'Neill was an actor and the father of the American playwright Eugene O'Neill. During his day, he was considered a promising actor, quickly working his way up the ranks to become a matinee idol. He shared stages with such renowned actors as Charlotte Cushman, Edwin Forrest, Edwin Booth, and Adelaide Neilson who said he was the best Romeo she ever had. As early as 1875, while a stock star at Hooley's Theatre in Chicago, O'Neill played the title role in a stage adaptation of Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo. To great commercial success, he went on to play this role about 6000 times. Some, including Eugene, saw O'Neill's willingness to play the role so many times as selling-- out \u2014 squandering the potential of his art in order to make money. James O'Neill later became the model for James Tyrone, the frugal, mercurial, unseeing father character in Eugene O'Neill's posthumous autobiographical play Long Day's Journey Into Night, which tells the story of the Tyrone family, which closely resembles the O'Neill family. Married to Ellen Quinlan on June 14, 1877, daughter of Thomas Quinlan and wife Bridget, both also of Irish ancestry, he had three sons: James (b. 1878), Edmond (b. 1883) and Eugene O'Neill. He died, aged 72, at the family home in Connecticut.
Arthur Garfield Hays (1881-1954) was born in Rochester, New York, on December 12, 1881. His father and mother, both of German descent, belonged to prospering families in the clothing manufacturing industry. After graduating from Columbia College in 1902 and Columbia Law School in 1905, Hays formed a law firm with two of his former classmates that gained prominence representing German interests in World War I. Hays was active in civil liberties issues before becoming general counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in 1920. From this point one can recognize the emergence of what many have called Hays's \"dual personality,\" in which he became a wealthy lawyer who represented the interests of power and fame (his more prominent clients ranged from Wall Street brokers and best-selling authors to notorious gamblers and the Dionne quintuplets)--while at the same time vigorously defending the individual liberty of victims of discriminatory laws. The list of famous cases in which Hays took part is lengthy, including the Scopes trial (often called the \"monkey trial\") in 1925 in which a school teacher in Tennessee was tried for teaching evolution; the Sacco and Vanzetti case in which two Italian anarchists in Boston were put to death in 1927 for a murder they denied committing; and the Scottsboro case where eight black men from Alabama were condemned to die in 1931 for allegedly attacking two white women. Hays also attended the Reichstag trial in Berlin on behalf of Georgi Dimitrov, a Bulgarian Communist accused by the Nazis in 1933 of burning the Reichstag. In addition to his work as a lawyer, Hays wrote numerous books and articles. As a gifted writer and eloquent debater, he added his perspective to virtually every individual rights issue of his day. His autobiography, entitled City Lawyer: The Autobiography of a Law Practice (1942), provides a colorful account of his more noteworthy cases, and his articles and book reviews demonstrate his wide-ranging knowledge of a nation and a world experiencing dramatic change in the way individual rights were perceived. Hays married Blanche Marks in 1908 and divorced her in 1924. They had one daughter, Mrs. Lora Spindell. He married Aline Davis Fleisher in 1924, who died in 1944. They also had a daughter, Mrs. Jane Butler. After more than four decades at the center of the individual rights debate, Hays died of a heart attack on December 14, 1954.

George Henry Boughton (December 4, 1833, Norwich, Norfolk - January 19, 1905, London) was an Anglo-American landscape and genre painter. A son of a farmer William Boughton, George Henry Boughton was born in England, but his parents emigrated to the United States in 1835, and he grew up in Albany, New York where he started his artistic career as a self-taught artist. On this early stage he was influenced by the artists of Hudson River School. By the age of 19 he was recognised as a landscape painter and opened his first studio in 1852. In 1853, the American Art Union purchased one of his early pictures which financed six months of styding art in England. He concluded this period of his training with a sketching tour to the Lake District, Scotland and Ireland. After coming back to USA, Boughton exhibited his works in Washington and New York, but in the late 1850s he finally made a decision to move to Europe. From 1859-1861 he studied art in France under Pierre-Edouard Frere (1819-1886) and Edward Harrison May (1824-1887). In 1861 Boughton opened a studio in London. Living in England, he nevertheless focused on subjects of early American Colonial history, and an American critic noticed that \"for early history of this country his talents seems to be peculiarly fitted. \" His subject-pictures, such as the Early Puritans of New England Going to Church (1867), were especially popular. The Return of the Mayflower shown at the Goupil Gallery, New York in 1871 was praised \"as a picture which will live as long as the memory of the Mayflower' itself lasts. \"Young Van-Gogh who visited London in 1873-1875 was much impressed by Boughton\u2019s painting God Speed! and wrote about it to his brother Theo. Boughton illustrated Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s The Scarlet Letter and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poems. In 1893, the edition of Washington Irving\u2019s Rip Van Winkle and Sleepy Hollow was piblished in London with 53 illustrations by Boughton. A London critic once declared that he \"has learnt the secret of putting natural feelings into rustic figures, which has been almost entirely wanting to English painters. \" Boughton exhibited extensively in both Britain and USA, and was elected a member of the National Academy of Design in New York in 1871, he was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours and an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1879, and a Royal Academician in 1896. \"He was a useful and popular member of this body, and worked well as member of the council, as a 'hanger', and as a teacher in the schools. \" After the death of John Callcott Horsley, Boughton was elected a Director of the Fine Art and General Insurance Company. Among his landscape paintings - views of England and Brittany in France. In 1883, he travelled to Holland. His illustrated account of that journey was published in the Harper's Magazine as 'Artist Strolls in Holland', and published next year in London as Sketching Rambles in Holland. He obviously took pleasure in writing: later he would participate in the publication of the 'English Art in the Public Galleries of London' providing the overview of George Morland's biography and work . Boughton easily socialised in London artistic circles and was a member of the Arts Club (1869-1896), of the Reform Club, the Athenaeum Club, the Burlington Fine Arts Club and the Grolier and Lotos Clubs in New York. In 1865, Boughton married Katherine Louise Cullen (1845-after 1901), and they had an adopted daughter, Florence. Along with John Callcott Horsley, he was one of the early clients of an architect Richard Norman Shaw who built for the Boughtons a house on Campden Hill, London. \"The parties given here by Mr and Mrs Boughton were celebrated among artistic and literary people and in the Anglo-American section of the society. \" It was noticed that Boughton was influenced by works of British painter and illustrator Frederick Walker (1840-1875). In the 1870s in London he met James Whistler. In 1878, an American reviewer praised them as \"shining lights in the art world\" of London. Boughton published vivid recollections about Whistler, particularly mentioning his work on the famous \u2018Peacock Room'. In 1877 he made an acquiaintance with Henry James (1843-1916). The female novelist Violet Hunt (1862-1942) based her novels Their Lives (1916) and Their Hearts (1921) on her early love affair with Boughton. The novel Christina Chard (1894) by Mrs Rosa Campbell-Praed (1851-1935), an Australian novelist, was dedicated to Boughton, because he had suggested the idea of the book. In the 1880s-1890s, he was associated with several artistic colonies in countryside, namely with the village of Broadway, Worcestershire, the rustic beauty of which was recognised by many American artists . Along with Henry James, Edwin Abbey, John Singer Sargent and others, he frequently visited Broadway. Through Horsley and Shaw he also was associated with the Cranbrook Colony of artists, visiting them in the late 1860s-1880s. Boughton died of heart disease, on January 19, 1905, in his studio at Campden Hill, London. His obituary stated that \"he was kindly, genial, humorous, a lover of a good story, the essence of hospitality, and wholly free from jealousy, malice, and incharitable judgments. \" His paintings are now represented in many museums of the United States and Europe.
The New York Five refers to a group of five New York City architects whose work appeared in a Museum of Modern Art exhibition organized by Arthur Drexler in 1967, and the subsequent book Five Architects in 1972. These five had a common allegiance to a pure form of architectural modernism, harkening back to the work of Le Corbusier in the 1920s and 1930s, although on closer examination their work was far more individual. The grouping may have had more to do with social and academic allegiances, particularly the mentoring role of Philip Johnson. The show did produce a stinging rebuke in the May 1973 issue of Architectural Forum, a group of essays called \"Five on Five\", written by architects Romaldo Giurgola, Allan Greenberg, Charles Moore, Jaquelin T. Robertson, and Robert A. M. Stern. These five, known as the \"Grays\", attacked the \"Whites\" on the grounds that this pursuit of the pure modernist aesthetic resulted in unworkable buildings that were indifferent to site, indifferent to users, and divorced from daily life. These \"Grays\" were aligned with Philadelphia architect Robert Venturi and the emerging interest in vernacular architecture and early postmodernism. John Hejduk was primarily an educator, and died in 2000. Charles Gwathmey died on August 3, 2009. The remaining three of the New York Five have produced significantly divergent work, and disavow any continuing relationship with each other. Graves embraced postmodernism. Eisenman has limited his work to images and models of architectural-looking designs in printed media, although he became the architect most associated with Deconstructivism. Meier's buildings remain truest to the modernist aesthetic and, true to Corbusian form. Gwathmey, too, remained true to modernist style, although its purity has been tempered by realities of larger corporate and public commissions.

Thom Pace (born Thomas M. Pace, 1949, Boise, Idaho) is a singer-songwriter who is best-known for the song \"Maybe,\" which became the theme of The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams. The song started out as a medley titled \"Wear The Sun In Your Heart/Maybe. \" Pace originally intended the song \"Maybe\" for a movie called The Snow Tigers, but ultimately it became the theme song of the Sunn Classic Pictures film and TV series, The Life And Times Of Grizzly Adams. The program starred Dan Haggerty as James Capen Adams, who had fled from false murder charges into the mountains and forest nearby. The made-for-television film The Capture Of Grizzly Adams, which starred Haggerty and also featured \"Maybe\" as its theme, finally showed Adams successfully clearing his name. Another version, the theme from an album that Pace recorded and released in the 1970s, was released as a single in Europe. \"Maybe\" went to number one in Germany and stayed there for nine weeks. Pace received the \"Goldene Europa\" Award, Europe's version of the Grammy Award for Best Song of 1979. He also wrote and composed, often in collaboration with Maria Hegsted, songs for other films including the NBC 'Movies of the Week', Vestige Of Honor and Can You Feel Me Dancing plus feature films, Night Of The Comet and State Park.

Roger John Traynor (February 12, 1900 &ndash; May 14, 1983) served as the 23rd Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of California from 1964 to 1970, and as an Associate Justice from 1940 to 1964. A nationally-respected jurist, Traynor's thirty-year career as California's 77th Justice coincided with tremendous demographic, social, and governmental growth in California and in the United States of America, and was marked by a belief (in the words of his biographer, G. Edward White) that \"the increased presence of government in American life was a necessary and beneficial phenomenon. \" Traynor has generally been viewed by the American legal community as the single greatest judge in the history of the California judiciary, and one of the greatest judges in the history of the United States. His obituary in the New York Times noted that \"Traynor was often called one of the greatest judicial talents never to sit on the United States Supreme Court. \" His 1948 opinion in Perez v. Sharp was the first instance of a state supreme court striking down a statute prohibiting miscegenation. Traynor also wrote a 1952 opinion that abolished the defense of recrimination in the context of divorce and paved the way for the social revolution of no-fault divorce. But his most significant and well-known contribution to contemporary American law is probably his 1963 creation of true strict liability in product liability cases. An earlier generation of judges had cautiously experimented with legal fictions like warranties to avoid leaving severely injured plaintiffs without any recourse. Traynor simply threw those away and imposed strict liability as a matter of public policy. To those skeptical of the power of government to redress social wrongs, Traynor's extraordinary work is notable for the degree to which it asserted the power of the judiciary to resolve difficult issues of public policy, and to redefine the boundaries of corporate and governmental liability. In his biography of Traynor, White wrote: \"If California was a testing ground for governmental theories of modern liberalism, Traynor was an architect of a judicial role compatible with the activities of the modern liberal state.\"

Robert Vavra (born in Glendale, California, March 9, 1935) is an American photographer and author universally acclaimed as the world's premier photographer of horses. By portraying the horse in his fresh and very personal way, he has become an icon in his own lifetime. He is the author of 37 books accounting for more than 3,000,000 volumes in print, in eight languages. Novelist James Michener once wrote of Vavra: \"Though equus has fired the imaginations of painters from Leonardo da Vinci, Velasquez, and Goya to Picasso; still, in the history of photography, no cameraman has recorded the horse with such excitement and personal style as has Robert Vavra. His images are works of art which are a joy to see because they evoke the inner nature of the horse. \" Beginning with his photographic tribute to the Spanish horse, Equus, published in 1977, his books have been praised by The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Chicago Tribune, The Times, Newsweek and Cosmopolitan Magazines, CNN, PBS, and Good Morning America. He has had more than 100 one-man gallery displays and museum shows in America and Europe. When Delacourt Press needs a cover shot for Nicolas Evan's novel, The Horse Whisperer, it calls Vavra. When Max Factor, Jordanche, Roche, Renault, or Revlon needs an artistic horse image for an advertisement, they call Vavra. When the Russian Republics need 24 horse photographs for postage stamp images, their choice is Vavra. His film work includes Lawrence of Arabia and Patton.... he was a creative advisor to Robert Redford during the filming of The Horse Whisperer. James Michener chose him to illustrate his nonfiction treatise on Spain, Iberia: Spanish Travels And Reflections, more than a year on The New York Times bestseller list. He's the author of Tiger Flower and Lion and Blue, two books listed by The New York Times Book Review as among the top ten children's books with the most adult appeal of all time. One of his best known horse-related projects is Horses Of The Wind, a music CD which includes Robert Vavra's photographs. Though mostly music, the CD includes horses' 'voices', a variety of whinnies and other equine vocalizations. Jane Goodall and William Shatner have introduced his documentary film on primitive equine behavior, Such Is The True Nature of Horses, the culmination of 20 years of research. Mr. Vavra is also known as an expert on the legacy of the Spanish fighting bull. Moving to Spain in 1958, he became immersed in the lore and life of this beast which culminated in the publishing of his book, Bulls of Iberia, in 1972. He was a personal friend of legendary matador de toros Juan Belmonte, riding with him on horseback to check his herds of black bulls, and he shared the dreams, fears, adventures and valor of other toreros, such as the American John Fulton. He has paid for the education of several Maasai children and financed the building of a school in Mexico, where, since its construction, more than 5000 boys and girls have learned to read and write. He has recently published a retrospective of his horse images, Vavra's Vision, and is currently at work on a book of profiles on African adventurers, 13 years in the making. This book's protagonists include Doris Lessing, Jane Goodall, Peter Matthiessen, Peter Beard, Paul Theroux, Mary Leakey, Sir Wilfred Theseger, Patrick Hemingway, etc, etc.

American Pimp is a 1999 documentary that examines the pimp subculture in the United States. It was directed by the Hughes Brothers, the filmmakers behind Menace II Society and Dead Presidents. The documentary consists of first person interviews of people involved in the pimping lifestyle. The interviews are separated by short clips from 1970's blaxploitation films such as Willie Dynamite, The Mack, and Dolemite. The first portion of the documentary focuses on pimps working illegally. The illegal pimps that are interviewed are from all over the United States, e.g. , Charm from Hawaii, Fillmore Slim from San Francisco, and Payroll from Las Vegas. These pimps, and many others discuss their theories on the history of prostitution. The pimps go on to talk about their philosophy on pimping, and how they live their daily life. The film also discusses the legal sector of prostitution. Dennis Hof, the owner of the Bunny Ranch in Nevada, is interviewed. He feels that Nevada is much smarter than the other states because they have imposed the proper health and background checks on prostitution, instead of trying to suppress prostitution by making it illegal. The majority of the documentary glorifies the pimping lifestyle. The pimps and prostitutes interviewed mainly discuss the perks of the lifestyle. They talk about the money they have made, and the expensive suits and cars they were able to buy; however, near the end of the film, the interviews involve prostitutes that have died from the lifestyle as well as pimps who have retired and hold straight jobs or those who are now in jail.

Wines explicitly expresses his own \"concern for the Earth. \" Having written at length on new modes of architecture, design, and planning, he has also provided succinct critique of the status quo in statements like: The [20th] century began with architects being inspired by an emerging age of industry and technology. Everybody wanted to believe a building could somehow function like a combustion engine. As an inspirational force in 1910, one can understand it. But as a continuing inspiration in our post-industrial world, or our new world of information and ecology, it doesn't make any sense. --from the film Ecological Design James Wines graduated from Syracuse University in 1956.

Eugenio Mario Perente-Ramos (Gino Perente) (21 November 1937 - 18 March 1995) was the founder of the National Labor Federation (NATLFED), a collection of anti-poverty organizations in the United States. The NATLFED's organizations conduct door-to-door canvassing and operate assistance programs for the poor, but it has also been described by critics as a left-wing \"political cult. \" Some reporters, cult-watchers, and the FBI inferred in the early 1980s that he was born Gerald William Doeden, a disc jockey and con artist from California. Gerald Doeden was born in Crookston, Minnesota and grew up in Idaho and Yuba City/Marysville, California. He was an amateur actor, performing in plays at Yuba College. Doeden married Ruth Mikkelsen in 1960, and had a daughter. Weidner reports that he had an illegitimate child and divorced Mikkelsen in 1962. He spent some time in jail for non-payment of child support, and some observers have suggested that he may have left California to avoid child support payments. Doeden was injured in a car accident and walked with a limp for the rest of his life. He was known in Marysville as a small-scale con artist. After working in Yuba City as a disc jockey for the radio station KAGR for about five years, Doeden began working at the Little Red Bookstore in San Francisco, where he went by aliases such as \"Calude\" and \"Gino Savo. \" A number of individuals associated with the store reportedly formed a short-lived group called Liberation Army Revolutionary Group Organization. The group sent letters to government offices \"announcing that armed guerrilla groups were about to attack public buildings\" in March of 1970. While this quickly attracted the attention of the authorities, the group was described as quixotic by the media and dismissed by law enforcement. Around 1970 Doeden left California and resurfaced in New York City as \"Gino Parenti. \" There he worked briefly in 1971 for the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee, the predecessor of United Farm Workers of America (UFW) in its New York office. After taking charge during a power vacuum, he was fired when UFW sent Jose Gomez to head the office. About 20 years later, he was remembered by Dolores Huerta as a \"colorful biker type who played a small role in the boycott for about nine months or a year. . . He created a lot of problems for the union, attacking us in the press. Then he went off and formed his own group. \" . After leaving UFW, Perente founded the Eastern Farm Workers Association (EFWA) in Suffolk County, New York, an agricultural region on Long Island. Within a few years, Perente's followers had started similar organizations patterned on EFWA in California and elsewhere on the east coast, and eventually one farm worker organizing drive had spawned a network of twenty such drives, called the National Labor Federation (NATLFED). By the late 1970s, Perente's activities were increasingly limited to giving lectures to volunteers interpreting the writings of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin and directing the daily activities of his volunteers. Perente also co-authored a number of tracts, including The Essential Organizer, the training manual of the EFWA, and \"The Genesis,\" a story of the origins of NATLFED claiming that the party was part of a secret International including the Communist Party of Cuba, the Sandinistas and revolutionaries in Chile and El Salvador, and that members of the Venceremos were among its founders. Perente retreated from public view in the mid- to late-1970s. Individuals associated with Perente purchased 1107-1115 Carrol St, an apartment building in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, and he lived there, surrounded by volunteers for his organizations, for the rest of his life. Some ex-full-time volunteers have alleged that Perente was a drug addict, sexually harassed female volunteers, and regularly physically abused some volunteer organizers during this period. Perente died March 18, 1995 in this apartment, of congestive heart failure. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemenery in Stony Brook, NY by the organization he founded. The New York Times printed an obituary of him, and then a correction. The initial obituary relied primarily on information from two close associates, Daniel Fiske and Christopher Day. The Times was then contacted by his former wife, former colleagues, and longtime critics of Perente, including Chip Berlet, and, after fact-checking the initial obituary, the Times issued a corrected obituary the next day.
Kevin Michael McMahon (born September 21, 1953 in Cleveland, Ohio) is a musician, singer, and songwriter for the long-standing bands Lucky Pierre and Prick. McMahon began recording with his pop group Lucky Pierre in 1974, releasing a number of vinyl singles though 1981. Lucky Pierre initially consisted of: John Guciardo- Lead Guitar, Brian Dempsey- Drums, Dennis DeVito- Bass and McMahon on Guitar &amp; Lead Vocals. In 1976, Tom Lash joined the band on bass guitar, and DeVito moved to guitar. Tom Miller played keyboards at this time. In 1977, Dempsey left the band and was replaced by drummer Gary Shay, and then drummer Dave Zima. After many live shows, both Tom Miller and John Gusciardo left Cleveland for California and DeVito switched to lead guitar. Many showcase concerts, radio broadcasts, and a few 45RPM singles followed. Lucky Pierre continued as a four-piece outfit, sometimes augmented by horns and vocalists to perform the array of song styles McMahon was developing. McMahon then went on hiatus until 1988, when Lucky Pierre recorded the Communiqu\u00E9 EP with Guciardo, Lash, Zima, and friend Trent Reznor making guest appearances. The 1988 line-up of Lucky Pierre included Trent Reznor, and was managed by Exotic Birds/NIN manager John Malm, Jr.. Lucky Pierre disbanded again after the recording of Communiqu\u00E9, but McMahon remained in contact with Reznor and Malm. During the early 1990s, McMahon began his second musical project, the industrial rock band Prick. Prick was eventually signed to Reznor and Malm's Nothing Records label. The band's debut self-titled album was released in 1995, with Reznor producing four of the album's ten tracks. Prick's lead single, \"Animal,\" received high rotation on MuchMusic and MTV, and Prick opened the US leg of Nine Inch Nails and David Bowie's Outside tour. Nothing's parent label, Interscope Records, dropped Prick before McMahon could record a follow-up. In the wake of this setback, McMahon went on another years-long hiatus from music. Prick reemerged in 2002 with The Wreckard, independently released by McMahon over the Internet, and featuring many songs once slated for the second, canceled Nothing Records album. Two years later, McMahon released Lucky Pierre's first full album, ThinKing, again selling the album independently online. In October 2008, McMahon re-emerged with the hard-rock track \"Runaway Brain,\" this time under the moniker (sic). The song was available from the fansite http://www. luckyprick. net/ for a limited time, with a note in the MP3's metadata noting, \"prick or treat - derailing things to come from luckypierremusic - THIS NOVEMBER (or ... it all depends on the speed of green)\". In an interview released in March 2009 on the fansite http://www. luckyprick. net/, McMahon talked about possible future releases, and also announced that http://www. luckypierremusic. com/ will be online again, with merchandising an re-releases of The Wreckard and ThinKing (in new packagings) for sale, and maybe re-mastered tracks of Lucky Pierre. On June 21, 2009, luckypierremusic. com went live, offering digital downloads, new and vintage shirts and hats, and new CDs. As alluded to previously, The Wreckard and ThinKing are being reissued, and the Fear of Blue and (sic) album and EP are also being released.

Dichelostemma is a genus of seven species of flowering plants in the order Asparagales. The genus is native to the western United States, especially in northern California, but also east to Utah and north to Oregon and southern Washington. Different classification systems place the genus in three different families. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group place it in family Themidaceae. Many other modern authors place it in the family Alliaceae. Both of these families are in the order Asparagales. However, older but still widely used sources such as ITIS place Dichelostemma in the family Liliaceae, in the order Liliales. The present article follows the recommendations of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. These plants grow from perennial corms that produce a raceme or umbel-like inflorescence. The flowers are bell- or tube-shaped and produce capsules with black seeds. The name, from the Greek for \"toothed crown\", refers to the stamen appendages. Dichelostemma was once included as part of the genus Brodiaea.
Born in Dalat, Vietnam in 1938, Gilles Larrain was first a painter, who went through the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and one of the pioneers in kinetic art in the 1960s, using air, smoke, light, water and neon tubes. Fascinated by the complementarity between paintings and photography, he became later a New York photographer and artist in Soho, where he realized among other works well-known posters of Miles Davis, Sting and Billy Joel. He also photographed John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Jerry Rubin and Salvador Dal\u00ED, and created record covers for Sting, Miles Davis and Billy Joel. Captivated by the flamenco aesthetic, Gilles has since become a great follower of this art, even taking up the guitar. His camera has captured the soul of flamenco in one of those rare artistic conjunctions where technical wisdom and experience become melded with the most difficult to express emotions. His works can be viewed at his official website: www. GillesLarrain. com
Mayers, Murray &amp; Phillip was an architecture firm in New York city and the successor firm to Goodhue Associates, after Bertram Goodhue's unexpected death in 1924. The principals were Francis L.S. Mayers, Oscar Harold Murray, and Hardie Phillip. The firm was initially occupied with executing Goodhue's unfinished projects and designs, such as eleven buildings on the Caltech campus alone. Buildings credited to the firm reflect Goodhue's characteristic massing and incorporation of ornament by longtime collaborators. Of the three, Hardie Phillip is solely credited with completing the Honolulu Academy of Arts. For the 1929 Church of the Heavenly Rest at 90th Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City, the firm completed a steel-frame, simplified Neo-Gothic limestone structure on land sold by the Carnegie family. The church features integrated architectural sculpture by Lee Lawrie in the form of Moses and John the Baptist emerging from the stonework, although most of the sculptural program was never executed. The design of the 1931 Oriental Institute on the grounds of the University of Chicago partly reflects the Egyptian Revival craze of the 1920s on a particularly appropriate building. A bas-relief above the door, designed by Institute director James Henry Breasted, depicts various symbolic icons and hieroglyphics, figures including Herodotus and Julius Caesar, and includes an image of Goodhue's Nebraska State Capitol. Goodhue's own Rockefeller Chapel is nearby. For the 1939 World's Fair, Mayers, Murray &amp; Phillip designed the Medicine and Public Health Building with interior murals by Hildreth Meiere, and three large allegorical sculptures to represent American virtues: Humility (the Devil and Texan folklore figure Strap Buckner), Efficiency (Paul Bunyan), and Benevolence (Johnny Appleseed). A surviving portion of Mayers, Murray &amp; Phillip's archive, including architectural drawings and photographs, is held by the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University.

Elihu Vedder (February 26, 1836 &ndash; January 29, 1923) was an American symbolist painter, book illustrator, and poet, born in New York City. He is best known for his fifty-five illustrations for Edward FitzGerald's translation of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (deluxe edition, published by Houghton Mifflin). Elihu Vedder was born February 26, 1836 in New York City, the son of Dr. Elihu Vedder Sr. and Elizabeth Vedder. His parents were cousins. His father, a dentist, decided to try his luck in Cuba and this had a profound impact on Elihu Jr. 's childhood. The remainder of his childhood was spent between his maternal grandfather Alexander Vedder's house in Schenectady and a boarding school. His mother supported his goals to be an artist while his father reluctantly assented, convinced that his son should try a different occupation. His brother, Dr. Alexander Madison Vedder, was a Navy surgeon who witnessed the transformation of Japan into a modern culture while he was stationed there. Vedder trained in New York City with Tompkins H. Matteson, then in Paris with Fran\u00E7ois-\u00C9douard Picot. Finally, he completed his studies in Italy - where he was strongly influenced not only by Italian Renaissance work but also by the modern Macchiaioli painters and the living Italian landscape. He first visited Italy from 1858 until 1860, becoming deeply emotionally attached to fellow painter Giovanni Costa. Their idyllic trips through the Italian countryside were cut short because Vedder's father cut off his financial allowance. Vedder returned to the USA, penniless, during the American Civil War, and made a small living by undertaking commercial illustrations. He was involved in the bohemian 'Pfaff's' coffee house group, and painted some of his most memorable paintings notable for their visionary nature, romantic imagery and often Oriental influences. Paintings of this time include 'The Roc's Egg', 'The Fisherman and the Genii' and one of his most famous works, 'Lair of the Sea Serpent. ' In the USA he sought out and became friends with Walt Whitman, Herman Melville and William Morris Hunt. Vedder became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1865. At the end of the Civil War he left America to live in Italy. He married Caroline Rosekrans on July 13, 1869 in Glen Falls, NY. Elihu Vedder and his wife had four children, only two of whom survived. His daughter Anita Herriman Vedder played a vital role in handling the business of her father, who was notorious for his general aloofness towards details. Elihu's son Enoch Rosekrans Vedder was a promising architect who married jewelry designer Angela Reston. Enoch died while visiting his parents in Italy on April 2, 1916. Elihu had a home in Rome and - after the financial success of his 1884 Rubaiyat work - on the Isle of Capri, then a haven for male aesthetes. Vedder visited England many times, and was influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites, and was a friend of Simeon Solomon. He was also influenced by the work of English and Irish mystics such as William Blake and William Butler Yeats. In 1890 Vedder helped establish the In Arte Libertas group in Italy. Tiffany commissioned him to design glassware, mosaics and statuettes for the company. He decorated the hallway of the Reading Room of the Washington Library of Congress, and his mural paintings can still be seen there. Vedder occasionally returned to the USA, but lived only in Italy from 1906 until his death on January 29, 1923.

Milton Menasco (January 22, 1890 \u2013 June 7, 1974) was an American painter and art director of silent movies born in Los Angeles, California. Born in 1890 in Los Angeles, California, Menasco began his art career in the early days of Hollywood and described his work then as the \"blood and thunder\" posters which enticed movie fans into theaters to watch the first silent pictures. He was commissioned for mural paintings at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco for the World's Fair in 1915. His vivid use of colors and graphics won him recognition in Hollywood, where he worked on 33 films--29 times as art director and twice as set director. In 1925 he was the architecture and set director for the original film based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World. This film received accolades for its innovative art direction and special effects. To quote one review in the NewTimes: \"And while Harry O. Hoyt is credited as director, a host of fellow auteurs must take credit for Lost World's still impressive thrills, especially the effects work of Willis O'Brien (who would later animate King Kong in 1933) and the wild set design from Milton Menasco. \" A complete list of Menasco's film credits is given here. In 1925 Menasco went to New York City as art director for a film making company and turned to advertising. He also painted portraits and water colors of horses and ships during this time which he sold in the City's galleries. During World War II, Life magazine commissioned him to draw air and sea battles to chronicle the war in Europe and in the Pacific Theater. After the war, Mr. Menasco moved to Kentucky to devote himself entirely to his real love, horse portraiture. Here he painted the equine racing greats of the nation and helped with art direction at the Thoroughbred Record and Sporting News. He and his wife purchased a farm where an old brick house built in the 18th Century served for many years as his studio. Horsemen admired the richness and feeling reflected in Menasco's paintings, and his clients included John Hay Whitney, Isabel Dodge Sloane, President Ronald Reagan and Allaire du Pont. One of his first large paintings was for Lucille Markey depicting nine of her horses at Calumet Farm including Citation, Coaltown and others grouped in the track with exercise boys up. He also painted Secretariat for owner, Penny Chenery. In 1953 Menasco painted the famous broodmare La Troienne in a work titled \"La Troienne and Her Foals\": Eighteen Vignettes and One Painting Together in One Frame\" for John Whitney. The painting was exhibited at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. In 1999 it sold from the estate of Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney through Sotheby's auction house for \u00A374,000 (c. US$120,000). In 1957, Menasco painted Doubledogdare and Delta for Arthur B. Hancock, Jr. The artist explained that although the actual painting had taken him about three months to complete, \"behind it goes all the training, study and experience of my life. \" A distinguishing mark of Menasco's paintings is the detail to sky and landscape backgrounds. A perfect example of this detail is apparent in Nashua, with Eddie Arcaro up, painted by Menasco at Hialeah Park for Leslie Combs II. The background shows the track and a ring of palm trees. Milton Menasco died in 1974 of a heart attack at his farm in Versailles, Kentucky.

Bennie Oosterbaan, Kramer's football coach at Michigan, described his blocking and tackling ability as the most valuable asset to the Michigan squad. Oosterbaan said this of his star player: \"To top off his marvelous physical gifts of size and speed and strength, plus an uncanny coordination, Kramer was one of the fiercest competitors I've ever seen. Nothing was impossible for him - the impossible was only a challenge. \" In 1999, Sports Illustrated published a list of \"The 50 Greatest Sports Figures From Michigan\" (in all sports), and ranked Kramer seventh on the list behind Joe Louis, Magic Johnson, Charlie Gehringer, Bennie Oosterbaan, Hal Newhouser, and Dave DeBusschere. \"The 50 Greatest Sports Figures From Michigan,\" Sports Illustrated, December 27, 1999.

James Brooks (October 18, 1906 &ndash; March 9, 1992) was an American muralist, abstract painter and winner of the Logan Medal of the Arts. Brooks was a friend of Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner on Eastern Long Island. In 1947 he married artist Charlotte Park. Considered a first generation abstract expressionist painter, Brooks was amongst the first abstract expressionists to use staining as an important technique. According to Carter Ratcliff \"His concern has always been to create painterly accidents of the kind that allow buried personal meanings to take on visibility. \" In his paintings from the late 1940s Brooks began to dilute his oil paint in order to stain the mostly raw canvas. These works often combined calligraphy and abstract shapes. Brooks had his first one-man exhibition of his abstract expressionist paintings in 1949 at the Peridot Gallery in New York. The Courtauld Institute of Art (London), the Dallas Museum of Art (Dallas, Texas), the Harvard University Art Museums, the Honolulu Academy of Arts, the Indianapolis Museum of Art (Indianapolis, Indiana), the Sheldon Art Gallery (Lincoln, Nebraska), the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington D.C. ), the Tate Gallery (London) and the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis, Minnesota) are among the public collections holding work by James Brooks.

James E. Myers (October 26, 1919 - May 9, 2001) was an American songwriter, actor, producer, and raconteur. Myers is best known as the credited co-writer of \"Rock Around the Clock\" for which he used the pseudonym \"Jimmy DeKnight\". Myers co-wrote the song with Max C. Freedman, though doubt has been cast as to whether Myers actually participated in the writing of the song. \"Rock Around the Clock\" was published in early 1953. Although Bill Haley &amp; His Comets were supposed to be the first to record it, a dispute between Myers and Dave Miller, Haley's producer for Essex Records prevented Haley from doing so (though Haley later claimed he tried several times to record it at Essex). The first recording of the song was made by an Italian-American band, Sonny Dae &amp; His Knights; Haley finally recorded it in 1954 for Decca Records and in 1955, the song became the first No. 1 record of the Rock and Roll era. Myers' songwriting career dated back to the 1940s, and his DeKnight moniker appears on several country and western recordings made by Haley in the 1949-51 era. Myers formed Myers Music to publish songs, and oversaw many of his own compositions as well as a number of Haley originals such as \"Rock-a-Beatin' Boogie\". It is also believed that Myers played drums on an early recording by Haley's pre-Comets group, the Saddlemen, though this has yet to be definitively confirmed. A later claim by Myers that he played drums on \"Rock Around the Clock\" has been debunked by the existence of an official recording session document indicating the drummer was Billy Gussak. The relationship between Myers and Haley collapsed in 1955-56 when Myers began providing songs to The Jodimars, a group made up of former Comets.

The Tule (Schoenoplectus acutus, syn. Scirpus acutus, Schoenoplectus lacustris, Scirpus lacustris subsp. acutus), also known as the common tule, hardstem tule, tule rush, hardstem bulrush, or viscid bulrush, is a giant species of sedge in the plant family Cyperaceae, native to freshwater marshes all over North America. The word derives from the indigenous Mexican word tullin, and was first applied by the early settlers from New Spain who recognized the marsh plants in the Central Valley of California as similar to those in the marshes around Mexico City. Tules once lined the shores of Tulare Lake, California, formerly the largest freshwater lake in the western United States, until it was drained by land speculators in the twentieth century. The expression \"out in the tules\" is still common, deriving from the dialect of old Californian families and means \"where no one would want to live\", with a touch of irony. The phrase is comparable to \"out in the boondocks\". It has a thick, rounded green stem growing to 1 to 3 metres (3\u201310 ft) tall, with long, grasslike leaves, and radially symmetrical, clustered pale brownish flowers. Tules at shorelines play an important ecological role, helping to buffer against wind and water forces, thereby allowing the establishment of other types of plants and reducing erosion. Tules are sometimes cleared from waterways using herbicides. When erosion occurs, tule rhizomes are replanted in strategic areas. There are two varieties: Schoenoplectus acutus var. acutus. Northern and eastern North America. Schoenoplectus acutus var. occidentalis. Southwestern North America.
Charles M. Conlon was an American photographer. He was born in Albany, New York in 1868. He worked for New York City newspapers in the early 1900s. He took many photos of major league baseball players. His most famous is the photo of Ty Cobb sliding into third base at Hilltop Park in 1909, upending the fielder, Jimmy Austin. However, to baseball historians or even casual fans, many of Conlon's photos of baseball's early stars are instantly recognizable, due to having been reprinted frequently over the years.
Eriogonum inflatum, the Desert Trumpet, is a perennial plant of the family Polygonaceae. The plant possesses very small yellow or pink flowers and an inflated stem just below branching segments. Eriogonum: from the Greek erion, \"wool\", and gonu, \"joint or knee\", in reference to the hairy or woolly joints of some of the species of the genus, but not particularly inflatum. The swelling of the stems was assumed to have been influenced by the presence of gall insects, most notably of the genus Onyerus. The female wasp produces a small hole on the inflated portion of the Desert Trumpet, packs the cavity with larvae and lays her eggs upon them, providing a food source, and a protected environment for the offspring. Irritation caused by this process was said to have enlarged the cavity over time. Recently, research performed by the world authority on the genus Eriogonum, Dr. J. L. Reveal of the University of Maryland, College Park, revealed the swollen stem of E. inflatum is due to high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the solid stem and seems to be related to gas regulation. Some insects utilize the swollen stem as a larder, but the inflation is not caused by the larval feeding of gall insects. It is known that some Native American tribes that once inhabited the surrounding areas of the Las Vegas Valley would remove the stalk of E. inflatum at the base, and then cut the inflated bulb in half, producing a makeshift pipe. A mixture of Indian Tobacco and Mistletoe would be smoked primarily for leisure purposes.
Phil Regan (28 May 1906 - 11 February 1996) was an American singer and actor, who later served time for bribery in a real estate scandal. Regan was born in 1906 in New York. He worked as a detective on the NYPD, before his singing was overheard by as radio producer at a party. This earned him the nickname \"The Singing Cop\". Regan went on to headline musical comedies at both Republic and Monogram studios. He retired in the mid 1950s. After retiring, Regan spent his time in his Palm Springs and Santa Barbara houses. His wife was Josephine and he had four children, Marilyn, Joan, Philip (Buddy), and Joseph. He also had 19 grand children. He also dabbled in politics, endorsing Ronald Reagan for governor of California in 1966 against incumbent Edmund G Brown. In 1972 he became involved with a developer named Halimi, who had created successful developments at Lake Tahoe and elsewhere. Halimi had purchased the option to develop a large coastal property on More Mesa in Santa Barbara, which required a permit from Santa Barbara County. Regan was aware that three of the five supervisors were in favor but he wanted to find a fourth vote for Halimi to avoid an appeal. He approached Frank Frost in December of 1972. Frost had just been elected to the Board of Supervisors and would take office in January. Frost perceived that an attempt at bribery was being arranged and reported his suspicions to the county district attorney and sheriff. A \"sting\" was planned and Regan passed $1000 to a friend of Frost's who posed as a go-between. Testimony at Regan's trial established that he had promised an additional $5000 for Frost's vote. Regan was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to two years in prison. He was released after one year. The formerly friendly supervisors made a good show of indignantly voting down the development of More Mesa. Upon his release, Regan returned to Santa Barbara. His wife of 70 years, Josephine Dwyer, died in 1994. Regan died on February 11, 1996.

Doris Gwendolyn Tate (January 16, 1924 &ndash; July 10, 1992) was an American campaigner for the rights of crime victims. After the murder of her daughter, the actress Sharon Tate, and several others, she worked to raise public awareness about the United States corrections system and was influential in the amendment of California laws relating to the victims of violent crime. Born in Houston, Texas, Tate was a housewife and mother of three daughters and had never sought a public life or career. In 1969, her eldest daughter, Sharon, was at the beginning of a film career, and married to film director Roman Polanski. Eight months pregnant with their first child, Tate and four others were murdered at the Polanski's Beverly Hills home in a case that was sensationalized throughout the world. The killers were eventually identified as Charles 'Tex' Watson, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel, acting on behalf of the leader of their group, Charles Manson. All four were found guilty of the murders and sentenced to death, along with Leslie Van Houten, who had not participated in the murder of the Tate victims, but had participated in the murder of a Los Angeles couple the following night. The death sentences were overturned before they could be applied when the State of California temporarily abolished the death penalty. For more than a decade after the murders, Tate battled depression and was withdrawn and unable to discuss her daughter's death. In 1982 she was told that Leslie Van Houten had obtained 300 signatures supporting her quest to achieve parole. Tate, who had vowed to keep her daughter's killers behind bars, mounted a public campaign against Van Houten, winning the support of the National Enquirer, which printed coupons in its magazine for people to sign and send to Doris Tate. With more than 350,000 signatures, Tate demonstrated that a considerable number of people opposed Van Houten's parole, which was denied. Tate, a shy woman, found herself thrust into the limelight, and realizing that she could continue to work on behalf of her late daughter, gradually adapted. She appeared on various television talk shows, discussing her opinion of the corrections system and the impact her daughter's murder had had on her family. She joined the Los Angeles chapter of the \"Parents of Murdered Children\" organization, and while she drew support from the group, also found that she was rewarded by assuming the role of counsellor. She later became an active member of the Victim Offender Reconciliation and Justice for Homicide Victims groups. She founded COVER, the Coalition on Victim's Equal Rights, and served on the California State Advisory Committee on Correctional Services as a victims' representative. She was part of a group that worked toward the passage of Proposition 8, the Victim's Rights Bill, which was passed in 1982. It allowed the presentation of victim impact statements during the sentencing of violent attackers. Tate became the first Californian to make such a statement after the law was passed, when she spoke at the parole hearing of one of her daughter's killers. In 1984 she ran for the California State Assembly as an advocate for victim's rights. Though unsuccessful, she continued to campaign for changes to existing laws, and was involved in the passage of Proposition 89, which allowed the governor of the state to overturn decisions made by the Board of Prison Terms. Tate was unflinching in her assessment of Manson, Watson, Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten, saying that their crimes were so vicious as to warrant execution. Susan Atkins, who had boasted of stabbing Tate because she was \"sick of listening to her,\" began to change her story as she sought to obtain parole. She had embraced religion and argued that, since God had forgiven her, she did not need the forgiveness of anyone else. Denying responsibility, she changed her story to say that she had argued with Watson against killing Tate. Doris Tate, at a parole hearing, called Atkins \"an excellent actress. \" Addressing Charles Watson at his 1984 parole hearing, she said, \"What mercy, Sir, did you show my daughter when she was begging for her life? What mercy did you show my daughter when she said give me two weeks to have my baby and then you can kill me? ... When will Sharon come up for parole?... Will these seven victims and possibly more walk out of their graves if you get paroled? You cannot be trusted. \" She confronted Watson again at his 1990 parole hearing. Doris Tate's health began to deteriorate after she was diagnosed with a brain tumour. In 1992, she was one of several volunteer workers recognized by President George H. W. Bush as one of a \"Thousand Points of Light. \" The ceremony, during which Tate and her family were honored by the President for their work in promoting victims' rights, marked Tate's final public appearance. She died later that year at the age of 68. Her work was taken over by her younger daughter, Patti, who was involved in the establishment of the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau, a non-profit organization with the aim of monitoring criminal legislation and raising public awareness. The Bureau began in Sacramento, California in July, 1993. In 1995, the Doris Tate Crime Victims Foundation was established with the aim of providing assistance to victims and their families. Patti began to represent the Tate family at parole hearings for Manson and the other killers until 2000, when she died from breast cancer. Her role was assumed by the middle Tate daughter, Debra.

James Foulis (December 11, 1870 &ndash; October 31, 1928) was a Scottish born professional golfer who won the second U.S. Open. Foulis was born in the \"Home of Golf\", St Andrews in Scotland. His father was foreman at Old Tom Morris's golf shop and clubmaking business, and Foulis spent some time working at the shop. In 1895 he travelled to the United States to take up a job as golf professional at Chicago Golf Club, which was the first club in the United States to have an eighteen hole course. He was the first golf professional in the western States. Foulis was one of the eleven players who took part in the first U.S. Open in 1895, and he came third. The following year he won the tournament at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club on Long Island. He was representing the Chicago Golf Club and he won $200. He was helped out by the fact that twice British Open champion Willie Park, Jnr, who would have been odds-on favourite if he had reached the United States in time to play, didn't dock in America until the day after the tournament. The following year the Open was played at Foulis's home club, and he finished third. The most notable aspect of his game was his driving; it is said that he often drove over three hundred yards using the relatively primitive clubs of his day. He continued to compete in the U.S. Open until 1906, but didn't win again. Jim Foulis and his brother Dave ran a golf shop at the Chicago Golf Club, and were played a significant part in the evolution of golf equipment. They invented the bramble patterning for Coburn Haskell's new rubber-cored ball. In response to the demands of the new ball the developed the \"mashie-niblick\", the modern seven iron, which fell between the traditional mashie (5-iron) and niblick (9-iron), and patented the design. Jim Foulis also worked as a golf course designer from 1896 until his death, designing the first golf courses in many communities across the Mid West. Foulis had four brothers, all of whom also moved to the United States. Robert and Dave were also golf professionals, Simpson was a fine amateur golfer, and John was an expert ballmaker who also worked as a bookkeeper at Chicago golf from 1901 to his untimely death in 1907. All five brothers are buried in Wheaton Cemetery, adjacent to Chicago Golf Club. His nephew, Jim, son of brother David, also a professional golfer, won the 1933 St. Paul Open.
John Matthew Shippen, Jr. (December 2, 1879 &ndash; May 20, 1968) was an African American/Native American golfer who competed in the several early U.S. Opens. He was the son of a Presbyterian minister, and was born in Washington D.C.. When he was nine his father was sent to serve as minister on the Shinnecock Indian Reservation, close to one of America's earliest golf clubs, Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. John, Jr. worked as a caddy at the course and was taught to play by the club's Scottish professional Willie Dunn. The Shinnecock Hills course was chosen to host the second U.S. Open, and the members were so impressed with Shippen's talent for the game that they decided to pay his entry fee for the tournament, along with that of his close friend, Oscar Bunn, a Shinnecock Indian. Shippen was allowed to play because he registered as an Indian (his mother was Shinnecock) rather than as a black. When the professional entrants for the competition found out about this they threatened to boycott the event, but they backed down after USGA president Theodore Havemeyer stated that the tournament would proceed even if only Shippen and Dunn took part. Shippen was paired with Charles B. Macdonald, winner of the first U.S. Amateur Championship in 1895. He was tied for second place after the first of the two rounds, and remained in contention until he drove his ball onto a sandy road at the 13th hole and scored an eleven. If he had made par on that hole, he would have made a playoff for the championship, but he still finished in a tie for sixth and won $10 as the fifth-placed non-amateur. Scottish born James Foulis won the $150 first prize. Shippen played in five more U.S. Opens, and his best finish was a tie for fifth in 1902. He made his career in golf and served as professional at several clubs, the last of which was Shady Rest Golf Course in New Jersey, where he worked from 1924 to 1960. As a professional, John Shippen made and sold his own clubs, which bore a stamp reading \"J.M. Shippen\" No other African-American played in the Open until Ted Rhodes took part in 1948. In 2009, the PGA of America granted posthumous membership to Shippen, Rhodes and Bill Spiller who were denied the opportunity to become PGA members during their professional careers. The PGA also has granted posthumous honorary membership to boxer Joe Louis.

Kate Richards O'Hare (1877-1948) was a prominent American Socialist anti-war activist during World War I. As the editor of the National Rip-Saw, a socialist journal, O'Hare critiqued American society from a socialist perspective. After the outbreak of war in 1917, O'Hare led the Socialist Party's Committee on War and Militarism. Due to her anti-war activities, she was imprisoned by the government for violating the Espionage Act of 1917, but in 1920 was pardoned by President Warren Harding after a nationwide campaign to secure her release. While in prison, she met the anarchists Emma Goldman and Gabriella Segata Antolini, and worked with them to improve prison conditions. O'Hare, unlike many Socialists at the time, supported segregation and wrote a 1912 pamphlet titled \"'Nigger' Equality\", which attempted to appeal to Southern voters . Her views on this issue have ruined her image for many socialists today, but at the time she was admired for her strong anti-war stance. Some have attacked the legacy of the Socialist Party based on her views on race, but they ignore the contributions of the Socialist Party to the struggle against segregation, and that frequent SP candidate Eugene V. Debs refused to speak to segregated audiences.

Ralph Goings (May 9, 1928 in Corning, California) is an American painter closely associated with the Photorealism movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. He is best known for his highly detailed paintings of hamburger stands, pick-up trucks, and California banks, portrayed in a deliberately objective manner. Goings studied art at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland. \"In 1963 I wanted to start painting again but I decided I wasn't going to do abstract pictures. It occurred to me that I should go as far to the opposite as I could. ... It occurred to me that projecting and tracing the photograph instead of copying it freehand would be even more shocking. To copy a photograph literally was considered a bad thing to do. It went against all of my art school training... some people were upset by what I was doing and said 'it's not art, it can't possibly be art'. That gave me encouragement in a perverse way, because I was delighted to be doing something that was really upsetting people... I was having a hell of a lot of fun...\"
Jerome Dunstan \"Jerry\" Travers (May 19, 1887 &ndash; March 29, 1951) was one of the leading amateur golfers of the early 20th century. He won the U.S. Amateur Championship in 1907, 1908, 1912 and 1913, the New Jersey Amateur three times, and the Metropolitan Amateur (New York) five times. He was regarded as one of the finest match play golfers of his time and had a famous rivalry with Walter Travis. Despite his great success as an amateur, Travers found it notoriously difficult to compete strongly in stroke play events. In several of the amateur championships in which he played, he only made it through the stroke play qualifying rounds on the cut line, before going on to succeed in the match play format. In 1915 Travers won the U.S. Open at Baltusrol Golf Club, making him the second of the five amateurs to win the event. It was his only top ten finish in four appearances at the U.S. Open - he never entered the tournament again once he had won it. Although all of Travers' notable victories came as an amateur, he later became a teaching professional and gave exhibitions. His motives for turning professional are questionable: after living in great comfort all his life his family suffered heavily after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, forcing him to seek a living in the professional game. He had actually retired from competitive golf previously to this, and he never had any great success as a professional. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1976.

Raised in the Bronx, he attended public schools and experimented with several creative forms before he discovered painting when he was 20. In the wake of the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Hafftka volunteered to work for a year on a Kibbutz in Israel. The \"momentous change brought on a series of visionary experiences and mystical dreams\", and when writing \"proved an inadequate outlet of expression,\" Hafftka began to paint\u2014an experience that proved \"revelatory and self defining. \" Back in New York, Hafftka worked as an artist while supporting himself with odd jobs. A voracious and broad reader and a frequent visitor to local museums, the artist discovered an affinity for Old Masters, such as Rembrandt and Goya, as well as for 20th-century artists, such as Giacometti and Bacon.

Jere Allen is an internationally known artist, currently Professor of Art at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, MS. His work can be described as figurative: strong colors, images, and symbols are often melded with portraits, providing a sense of an artist looking for answers and a reality that never fully materializes. His work is typically inspired by myths and symbols. These factors combined had him labeled in 1999 by a regional newspaper as \"the Mississippi Rembrandt\". Art and Antiques has described Allen as a \"modern-day master\" known for his \"dramatic, electric colors. \" Allen himself describes his work thus: \"My paintings employ a reactive method in the search for an elusive notion that has perplexed me for many years. The (pictures) that stem from personal, social, political realities are often a foil to assist in the realization of feelings generated by that evasive notion. \" His work can be found at the Huntsville Museum of Art and Mobile Museum of Art, both of which are in Alabama. They can also be found at the Meridian Museum of Art, Mississippi, and Coos Art Museum, in Coos Bay, Oregon. In 2003, Allen's work, along with that of Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein, and Wolf Kahn, toured Southeast Asia in the Washington-based Meridian International Center's exhibition, Outward Bound: American Art at the Brink of the Twenty-First Century, co-curated by fellow Mississippian Bill Dunlap. Jere Allen has an artist son, Jeffery M. Allen, though their styles vary considerably.

Regina Richards, better known by her stage name Regina, is a dance music singer born in Brooklyn, New York. She is best known for her hit \"Baby Love,\" which reached Number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1986. [She is not to be confused with another artist named Regina (from Brasil, who charted with \"Day by Day\" in 1997), or the 2006 album by The May Petals called \"Regina. \"] Regina graduated from Marymount Manhattan College in 1979 with a degree in theatre. She began her musical career as part of the New York punk and new-wave scenes. Her first single \"Tyger\" was released by A&amp;M Records in 1980. She then released an album as Regina Richards and Red Hot on A&amp;M, followed by a solo single, \"Deep Dreaming,\" for that label. Initially, Regina only wished to pursue success in the mainstream style as a songwriter, with the idea that her work as a performer would remain in an alternative music vein. Regina co-wrote \"Baby Love\" with frequent Madonna collaborator Stephen Bray; it was submitted to Madonna, who declined to record it&mdash;leaving Regina and Bray to record it themselves. At the time of the song's release, many people thought \"Baby Love\" was performed by Madonna, due to Bray's distinct and then-Madonna-familiar production values; Regina's vocals, filtered through this production style, did bear a similarity to Madonna's. Because of this, Regina was unduly considered a \"Madonna wannabe\" by many. \"Baby Love\" was taken from Regina's Curiosity album, which also included \"Say Goodbye,\" a song she'd originally written with Kenny Rogers in mind. Regina remains a one hit wonder on the Billboard Hot 100, but in addition to the #1 placing of \"Baby Love,\" she saw three other songs hit the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart&mdash;\"Beat of Love,\" \"Head On,\" and \"Extraordinary Love. \" In 1987 she lensed an anti-drug public service announcement with the animated \"McGruff the Crime Dog\" that aired well into the 1990s. There was a second Regina album in the works entitled Best Kept Secret, but it was shelved and never released due to record label resistance to its more alternative sound. In 1991, Australian singer Dannii Minogue released a cover of \"Baby Love\" as a single, reaching #14 in the UK. Regina&mdash;who now goes by the name Regina Lee&mdash;is married to a physician, and is currently raising four children in Augusta, Georgia.
Barbara Roy was born in Kinston, North Carolina and is a dance music singer.

Hermann Ottomar Herzog (November 15, 1831 &ndash; February 6, 1932) was a prominent nineteenth- and early twentieth-century European and American artist, primarily known for his landscapes. He was born in Bremen, Germany and entered the D\u00FCsseldorf Academy at age seventeen. Herzog achieved early commercial success, allowing him to travel widely and continue his training. His patrons included royalty and nobility throughout Europe. In the late 1860s, after an extensive trip to Norway, Herzog settled permanently near Philadelphia in the United States. Thereafter, he traveled throughout the U.S. and Mexico. He painted his way across the western states, arriving in California in 1873. His works from this trip included a series of Yosemite Valley paintings. In 1876, he received an award at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition for his painting of Sentinel Rock in Yosemite. Herzog also made extensive trips to Maine and Florida to paint. Because he was a prudent investor, Herzog did not have to depend on the sale of his artwork to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. Following his death, his family retained a large group of his paintings, most of which were released to the art market in the 1970s. A number of prominent American and European museums now include Herzog's work as part of their collections. Herzog's work is sometimes considered to be part of the Hudson River School, although it is more realistic and less dramatic than works by peers Frederick Edwin Church or Albert Bierstadt. He almost always signed his work \"H. Herzog\"; as a result, his first name is spelled both \"Herman\" and \"Hermann\" in various sources. His birth year is often incorrectly reported as 1832. The Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania held a major exhibition of Herzog's work in 1992 and published a catalog of his work, with an essay by art historian Donald S. Lewis, Jr. In his long life, Herzog created more than 1,000 paintings, including \"Women in a Tropical Setting\" and \"Landscape with a Bear and her Cub\".

Frat House is a documentary film exploring the darker side of fraternity life. The film was directed by Todd Phillips and Andrew Gurland, and largely filmed at Allentown, Pennsylvania's Muhlenberg College; the majority of the film was shot in the house of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, which has since been banned from Muhlenberg. The opening fraternity, that drove the filmakers out of the college and the town, is the Beta Chi fraternity on the State University of New York College at Oneonta campus in Oneonta New York. Beta Chi is an Unrecognized fraternity in Oneonta, and was kicked off the Oneonta campus after reports of severe Hazing. it continues to operate as a rogue, unrecognize chapter in the town to this day. Other unregognized fraternities from SUNY Oneonta shown in the film include Sigma Alpha Mu, also known as \"Sammy\", and Tau Kappa Epsilon, which was recognized in the spring of 2007 but shortly thereafter lost their recognition from the campus. Frat House won two Sundance Film Festival awards in 1998, but has been attacked for containing sequences that were staged for the cameras. Frat House was originally intended to be shown on the HBO TV channel, but was never aired after receiving allegations that much of the final portion of the film was staged. The sequences concerned involved 'hazing', in which aspring members of the fraternity (known as 'pledges') are seen undergoing humiliating initiation rites. The allegation is that the pledges who appear on screen were in fact already members of the fraternity: the fraternity chapter was paid $1500 to film the events, and several members were paid $50 each to pretend to be pledges and re-enact things that were rumored to happen during fratenity pledging rituals. The filmmakers signed non-binding forms stating that the school and fraternity names would not be used, and that the events did not reflect the behavior of the fraternity. The deceit was noticed because the film was shot in the Spring, but Muhlenberg College did not rush during the Spring. Phillips and Garland claim their film is completely accurate, but they have not refuted the claim that pledging did not happen during the Spring at Muhlenberg College. While not admitting to have done it himself, Phillips argues that staging re-enactments of true events is a technique used by well-known documentarians such as Nick Broomfield and Michael Moore.

His paintings have been displayed in more than 150 exhibitions during the past 20 years, including thirty one-person shows in Cleveland, New York City, Phoenix, and Germany.

He has two children: Christopher Benjamin Utter, born 2/9/84 and Elizabeth Anne Hyler, born 8/26/85. About his recent exhibit \"Asymptotes\" he says: In geometry, an asymptote is a line or curve that approaches, but never quite meets another line. Since the mid 1980\u2019s many of my paintings have been about emotional commitment, and about the way that people touch or do not touch one another, physically and spiritually. Mainly I think intimacy is a matter of approximations; we do the best we can, but most often sympathy, for instance, can only approach empathy, unless it overshoots its goal and sinks in a welter of self-pity. In my experience it is very hard to lose oneself entirely, or give all of oneself, to a cause, or to another human being, or to the act of painting. Although most of these eighteen works on canvas deal with the situation of a single human presence, distorted by mood or circumstance, they are essentially about how hard, and how necessary, it is to try to touch. Recently, Utter has contributed to the upcoming book about friend and colleague Stephen Kasner. .

Dion McGregor (1922\u20131994) was a New York City-born songwriter, whose main claim to fame is that he was a dreamer, or somniloquist. As a songwriter, McGregor's biggest success came when his song \"Where Is The Wonder\" (cowritten with roommate Michael Barr) was recorded by Barbra Streisand on her hit album My Name Is Barbra (1965). He was unable to find much success afterwards, however, and by the 1980s had given up on songwriting. Critic Joslyn Layne writes that \"Despite his lack of success as a song lyricist, McGregor's narration of his vivid dreamlife provided a more unique artistic contribution than any usually recorded. \" McGregor talked in his sleep. Not in quiet, barely-comprehensible mumbles: while he slept, McGregor would essentially narrate his dreams at conversational volume. As a narrator of his (often terrifying) dreams, Dion adopted various personas but frequently established a, argumentative, approach to the subject at hand &ndash; be it a hot air balloon trip to the moon with a group of multi-ethnic children, a frantic journey around New York, or a tattooing job on a woman's tongue. An LP of his dream diatribes &ndash; The Dream World Of Dion McGregor (He Talks In His Sleep) &ndash; was even released to minor acclaim by Decca Records in 1964. A book of the same name, containing the transcripts of a wider selection of McGregor's dreams, and with illustrations by Edward Gorey, was also published in 1964. McGregor died in 1994, but researcher Phil Milstein gathered recordings of McGregor's dream-speech considered too risque to be released in the 1960s and assembled them for the 1999 album, Dion McGregor Dreams Again, released on Tzadik Records. A third album, The Further Somniloquies of Dion McGregor: More Outrageous Recordings of the World's Most Renowned Sleeptalker was assembled by Toronto poet Steve Venright and released in August 2004 on the Torpor Vigil Industries label.

Pholisma sonorae, commonly known as Sandfood, is a rare and unusual species of flowering plant endemic to the Sonoran Desert to the west and south of Yuma, Arizona, where it is known from only a few locations. It is a perennial herb which grows in sand dunes, its fleshy stem extending up to two meters below the surface and emerging above as a small rounded or ovate form. It may be somewhat mushroom-shaped if enough sand blows away to reveal the top of the stem. It is a parasitic plant which attaches to the roots of various desert shrubs such as wild buckwheats, ragweeds, plucheas, and Tiquilia plicata and T. palmeri to obtain nutrients. As a heterotroph, the plant lacks chlorophyll and is grayish, whitish, or brown in color. It has glandular scale-like leaves along its surface. The plant obtains water not from its host plants, but through stomata in its leaves. The plant blooms in centimeter-wide flowers which are pink to purple in color with white margins. This was an important food item for certain desert-dwelling Native American peoples, including the Cocopah and the Hia C-ed O'odham. The plant is rare and declining as its habitat of shifting dune sands is lost to development and damaged by off-road vehicle use.

A year or so later, he went to Illinois with a survey team for the railroad. He worked with the survey team for a couple of years and again returned home. He entered Deerfield Academy and began to paint in his spare time. In 1841, his desire to paint overcame his parents opposition. He joined his half-brother Augustus as an itinerant painter, and enjoyed some success painting portraits in northern New York. That winter he went to Albany where he studied painting with Henry Kirke Brown for nine months. The next two winters, he studied painting with the Boston Artists' Association, working on the family farm in the summers. In 1846 he sold \"A Nun at Confession\" for six dollars. In 1847, he enrolled in the National Academy of Design in New York. He spent most of the next ten years in New York. Some winters he spent in the South painting portraits and scenes about local life. In 1857 he was elected an associate of the National Academy. His father died in 1859, and he became aware that he would eventually need to return to the family farm to support his family. In January 1860 he began five month a tour of Europe with friends during which they visited London, Paris, Florence, Rome, and Venice. He married Agnes Higginson of Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1861 and brought her home to the Deerfield farm. For the next fifteen years, he worked the farm and painted in his spare time in a studio converted form a carriage house. His farm failed in 1875, and he turned to painting for his livelihood. In the spring of 1876, the opening of his first art exhibition relaunched his career as a painter. In 1878 the National Academy exhibition included his \"Turkey Pasture in Kentucky\" and \"By the Wayside\". The following year he sent to the Academy \"And She Was a Witch\" and \"The Romany Girl\". He sent more pictures to the Academy in 1881 as his reputation and commercial success grew. In 1881, Fuller gave the painting, Repears Resting, as his first to be exhibited at the Boston Art Club. He then exhibited one painting there in 1880, one painting in 1881, three paintings shown at the 1882 Boston Art Club exhibition, and his final painting exhibited at the Club, Portrait of Miss C. , was January 19-February 16, 1884.

A contemporary of fellow expatriate painter John Singer Sargent, Stewart was nicknamed \"the Parisian from Philadelphia. \" His father, the sugar millionaire William Hood Stewart, moved the family to Paris in 1865, and became a distinguished art collector and an early patron of Fortuny and the Barbizon artists. Julius studied under Eduardo Zamacois as a teenager, under Jean-L\u00E9on G\u00E9r\u00F4me at the \u00C9cole des Beaux Arts, and later was a pupil of Raymondo de Madrazo. Stewart's family wealth enabled him to live a lush expatriate life and paint what he pleased, often large-scaled group portraits. The first of these, After the Wedding (1880), showed the artist's brother Charles and his bride Mae, daughter of financier Anthony J. Drexel, leaving for their honeymoon. Subsequent group portraits depicted his friends &mdash; including actresses, celebrities and aristocrats &mdash; often with a self-portrait somewhere in the crowd. He exhibited regularly at the Paris Salon from 1878 into the early 20th century, and help organize the Americans in Paris section of the 1894 Salon. The Baptism (1892), which reportedly depicted a gathering of the Vanderbilt family, was shown at the 1893 Chicago World Columbian Exposition, and received acclaim at the 1895 Berlin International Exposition. He painted a series of sailing pictures aboard James Gordon Bennett Jr. 's yacht Namouna. The most accomplished of these, On the Yacht \"Namouna\", Venice (1890), showed a sailing party on deck and included a portrait of the actress Lillie Langtry. Another, Yachting on the Mediterranean (1896), set a record price for the artist, selling in 2005 for US$2,312,000.

Frank Fay (b. November 17, 1891 - d. September 25, 1961) was an American film and stage actor, emcee, comedian, best-known as an actor for having played \"Elwood P. Dowd\" in the play Harvey by the American playwright Mary Coyle Chase on Broadway. James Stewart would play the role in the film version. Born as Francis Anthony Donner in San Francisco, California to Irish Catholic parents. He took the professional name of Frank Fay after concluding that his birth name was not suitable for the stage. He enjoyed considerable success as a variety artist starting around 1918, telling jokes and stories in a carefully planned \"off the cuff\" manner that was very original for the time. Jack Benny stated that he modeled his early stage character on Fay. During the 1920s Fay was vaudeville's highest-paid headliner, earning $17,500 a week. When talkies arrived, the Warner Bros. were eager to put him under contract along with a host of other famous stage personalities. Frank Fay was cast as master of ceremonies in Warner's Brothers most expensive production of 1929, the all-star all-color all-talking revue The Show of Shows (1929). Based on the success of that film, Fay was quickly signed up for an all-Technicolor musical comedy entitled Under A Texas Moon (1930) in which he also displayed his singing abilities. The movie was a box office success and produced a song hit of the theme song which was also titled \"Under A Texas Moon\". Fay sang the theme song several times throughout the picture. Another expensive picture, Bright Lights (1930), an extravagant all-Technicolor musical, quickly followed. Frank Fay also starred in The Matrimonial Bed (1930), a Pre-Code comedy in which he sang the theme song twice. Frank Fay quickly found himself associated with musical films and this led to a decline in his popularity when the public became sick of musicals late in 1930. In his next film, God's Gift to Women (1931), which was originally planned as a musical, was cut partially before release in order to remove the musical sequences. In this film, Frank Fay failed to get the rave reviews he had previously enjoyed. He attempted to produced his own picture in 1932 and struck a deal with Warner Bros. to have them release his film. This film was titled A Fool's Advice (1932) and proved to be only moderately successful. Frank Fay married Barbara Stanwyck when she was relatively unknown. Fay helped her jump star her career in films and she was given a contract by Warner Bros. late in 1930. They married in 1928 (1928\u20131936) they adopted a son, Dion, on December 5, 1932. The marriage reportedly soured when Fay's career was eclipsed by Stanwyck's success. Some film historians have claimed that the Fay-Stanwyck marriage was the basis for A Star is Born, but this has not been confirmed. Their only film appearance together was a brief skit in the short film The Stolen Jools (1931). Fay's Broadway talent and early success in talkies with his Pre-Code humor did not bode well with the rising conservative movement ushered by the Great Depression. Fay played in a series of films casting him as a debonair lover, irresistible to women, but constantly threw in suggestive Pre-Code jokes (e.g. homosexuality, sex). He was successful as a revue and night club comedian and Master of Ceremonies and appeared frequently on radio shows. (He was cast in a bit part as master of ceremonies in the night club sequence of Nothing Sacred. ) As late as the 1950s one of his most enduring routines was taking a popular song and analysing the \"senseless\" lyrics, for example \"Tea for Two\":&mdash; \"\"Picture you, upon my knee. \" (This guy just owns one chair?) \"Just tea for two and two for tea, me for you, and you for me, alone\" So, here's the situation: the guy just has one chair, but enough tea for two, so he has two for tea. If anyone else shows up, he shoots 'em! \"Nobody near us, to see us or hear us. \" Who'd want to listen to a couple of people drinking tea? \"We won't have it known dear that we own a telephone. \" So, this guy's too cheap to get another chair, he has a telephone, but won't tell anyone about it! \"Dawn will break, and you'll awake, and start to bake a sugar cake. \" Oh, this poor woman's life, I can see it now. Dawn breaks, and she's got to start baking, can't even run a brush through her hair, down in the dark, feeling around for the flour... \"For me to take for all the guys to see. \" I can see that! \"Hey, guys, I've got something the wife gave me!\" Is it a new tie? Is it a set of tires? Nahhh- it's a sugar cake! Three layers, with a cocoanut cream filling! \"Oh, that's just ducky!,\" they all say, and they crown him with it.

Charles \"Chas\" Lawther is a British-born Canadian actor, comedian and writer. Lawther came to local prominence in Toronto when in the 1980s he created the character of Chuck The Security Guard for CFMT-TV's The All-Night Show, on the ostensible premise that as the station's night security he would be allowed to use the broadcast facilities to play classic television shows, short films and music videos between sign-off and 6 a.m. The station CFMT bulk erased all episodes of The All Night Show to reuse the tapes. (Jeff Silverman the shows producer did not want the station to reuse the program tapes of the live segments when contract negotiations failed -the shows budget was $450,000 for the year,he wanted $50,000 more for the next year and CFMT wanted the show done for $50,000 less, so the show was going to be canceled by the station and Silverman ordered the covert bulking of all the program tapes but 3/4\" u-matic copies of some the show's best moments still survive). Lawther and his comedy partner Suzette Couture formed the comedy duo Joined at the Hip, regularly playing comedy venues across Canada and at one point getting their own special on CBC.

Kehinde Wiley (born in Los Angeles, California in 1977) is a New York based painter who is known for his paintings of contemporary urban African American men in poses taken from the annals of art history. His painting style has been compared to that of such traditional portraitists as Reynolds, Gainsborough, Titian and Ingres. The Columbus Museum of Art, which hosted an exhibition of his work in 2007, describes his work with the following: \"Kehinde Wiley has gained recent acclaim for his heroic portraits which address the image and status of young African-American men in contemporary culture. \" Wiley\u2019s paintings often blur the boundaries between traditional and contemporary modes of representation. Rendered in a realistic mode \u2013\u2013 while making references to specific old master paintings \u2013\u2013 Wiley creates a fusion of period styles, ranging from French rococo, Islamic architecture and West African textile design to urban hip\u2013hop and the \"Sea Foam Green\" of a Martha Stewart Interiors color swatch. Wiley\u2019s slightly larger than life size figures are depicted in a heroic manner, as their poses connote power and spiritual awakening. Wiley\u2019s portrayal of masculinity is filtered through these poses of power and spirituality. His portraits are based on photographs of young men who Wiley sees on the street, begun last year with men mostly from Harlem\u2019s 125th Street, the series now includes models from the South Central neighborhood where he was born. Dressed in street clothes, they are asked to assume poses from the paintings of Renaissance masters, such as Titian and Tiepolo. Wiley also embraces French rococo ornamentation; his references to this style complement his embrace of hip\u2013hop culture. Similarly, the poses of his figures appear to derive as much from contemporary hip\u2013hop culture as from Renaissance paintings. The artist describes his approach as \"interrogating the notion of the master painter, at once critical and complicit. \" Wiley\u2019s figurative paintings \"quote historical sources and position young black men within that field of power. \u201D In this manner, Wiley\u2019s paintings fuse history and style in a unique and contemporary manner. Kehinde Wiley\u2019s works reference paintings by Titian and Tiepolo, but he also draws from other styles ranging from the French Rococo to contemporary urban street. Kehinde Wiley\u2019s exhibition Infinite Mobility recently appeared at the Brooklyn Museum in New York. Two of Wiley's pieces are highlighted as part of the Collected Identities exhibition currently on display at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University. He designed the new puma V1.10 which many players are going to wear in the African cup of nations and also the World cup. Wiley is featured in a commercial on the TV network USA as a 2010 Character Honoree. His work currently resides in National Portrait Gallery (United States) as part of the Recognize exhibit.

Wild Radish or Jointed Charlock, Raphanus raphanistrum, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is sometimes claimed to be the ancestor of the edible radish, Raphanus sativus. Native to Asia (or, according to some authorities, the Mediterranean), it has been introduced into most parts of the world, and is regarded as a damagingly invasive species in many, for example Australia. It spreads rapidly, and is often found growing on roadsides or in other places where the ground has been disturbed. In southeastern USA, the pale yellow form is common, sometimes entirely taking over fields in wintertime. It is often erroneously identified as mustard. It is a significant source of pollen and nectar for a variety of pollinators, especially honey bees during the very early spring starting buildup. Wild radish grows as an annual or biennial plant, with attractive four-petalled flowers 15-20 mm across and varying in colour, usually from white to purple but sometimes light orange to yellow, often with colour shading within a single petal. It is frost hardy, and even hard freezes only temporarily interrupt bloom. It blooms in early spring to late summer with flowers very similar to those of the searocket, which is found in some of the same regions and is easily distinguished from it by having thinner, non-succulent stems and leaves. It has a single taproot which is similar to that of the cultivated radish but less enlarged.

They also often find humour in the situations she encountered. Her work is some of the finest in the extensive archive. In 1941 she met Lee Wolcott. When she had finished her assignments for the FSA she married him, and later had to fit in her photography around raising a family and a great deal of travelling and living overseas.

Walter J. Lubken (1882-1960) was an official photographer for the United States Reclamation Service (USRS) from 1903 to 1917. During these years, Lubken took thousands of photographs documenting the Reclamation Service's irrigation projects across the American West. He recorded the progress of construction projects as well as USRS machinery and personnel. The agency also asked Lubken to photograph nearby towns and farms for a series of articles designed to promote settlement on land reclaimed from the desert through irrigation. Traveling with his large camera and glass-plate negatives, he documented 25 projects in 17 Western States. After leaving the Reclamation Service in 1917, Lubken left professional photography until the 1930s, when he photographed the building of Boulder Dam. Lubken's photographs capture both engineering feats and everyday life in the early 20th-century West. His optimistic images impress the viewer with the technological and social advances made by westerners. They make the point that progress and community had come to isolated, formerly barren places, and that abundant opportunities awaited those willing to move west and work hard on the reclaimed land. Walter was born Walter John Lubken, the fourth of six children on 24 August 1882 in Boise ID, to George Lubken, a German baker from New York City, and Hellena Aldelmann. He married Alice Cornelia (Hoagland) Hall, a divorcee, the daughter of John Aaron Hoagland (1861-1929) and Harriet Maria Louditt Rupp (1862-1949), of Mormon Church fame, on 4 December 1911 in Boise, Ada, Idaho. They had no children, but Walter did assist in the raising of Alice's only child by her former marriage to Alva Archer Hall (1877-1942). After photography, Walter went back to a former career working as a dry goods store clerk, which profession he apparently was more proud of than his short stint with fame as the \"Government Photographer,\" and died quietly in his home town of Boise some time in June of 1960 at the age of 77 according to the 1 July 1960 AP Wire.

Adolf Cluss (July 14, 1825 \u2013 July 24, 1905) was a German-born American immigrant who became one of the most important architects in Washington, D.C. , in the late 19th century, responsible for the design of numerous schools and other notable public buildings in the capital. He was born in 1825 in Heilbronn in the Kingdom of W\u00FCrttemberg in south-west Germany. His father was a master builder, and young Cluss set out as an itinerant carpenter when he left Heilbrunn at age nineteen. In his travels, he met and became a friend of Karl Marx and a supporter of communist principles at a time of political and revolutionary ferment in Germany. He joined the Communist League and became a member of the Mainz Worker Council. The failure of the German revolutionary movement in 1848 led him to leave Germany when he was twenty-three, along with other Forty-Eighters who emigrated to the United States at that time. In the United States, he continued his political activity into the 1850s, maintaining an extensive correspondence with Marx and Engels and writing and publishing political articles for the German-American community. Settling in Washington, D.C. , Cluss also began building a highly successful practice as an engineer and architect. In the following decades, from the 1860s to the 1890s, he was responsible for designing scores of major public buildings, including at least eleven schools, as well as markets, government buildings, museums, residences and churches. By 1872, he had become City Engineer and a member of the Board of Public Works, overseeing some of the civic improvements that transformed Washington in the 1870s: street paving, sewer construction, and the planting of thousands of street trees. Cluss's schoolhouse designs were particularly innovative and influential, though only two of his red-brick school masterpieces remain, Franklin School and Sumner School in downtown Washington. The Franklin School was completed in 1869 earning the Washington public school system a Medal for Progress. He designed four major buildings on the National Mall, including the still-standing Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building. He built six houses of worship, including Calvary Baptist Church, located at 777 8th Street, N.W. Two of the city's major food markets, Center Market and Eastern Market, were built to his design, the latter surviving and restored to use after a disastrous 2007 fire. His flagship store for Lansburgh's opened in 1882. Cluss was also active as a builder of mansions for the Washington elite. In 1880, he was hired to create what became Washington's first apartment building, Portland Flats, an ornate, six-floor, 39-unit creation on the south side of Thomas Circle. Almost all of Cluss' residential creations have been demolished\u2014Portland Flats, for instance, was torn down in 1962 to make way for an office building. Red brick was Cluss' favorite building material; that, and his early communist sympathies, led some to dub as the \"Red architect\" a man who in later life became a confirmed Republican. A descriptive list of Cluss's known buildings and an interactive map showing their locations can be found here.

At 22, she married songwriter/disc-jockey Sherm Feller, who assumed an active role in promoting her career. Throughout the 1940s and 1950's she recorded a series of hits including \u201CI'm a Little Teapot\u201D, \u201CKiss Me Sweet\u201D (given the distinction of being banned by CBS due to Valentine\u2019s suggestive delivery of the refrain \u2018Kiss my little . . . cares away\u2019), and \u201CShe Was Five And He Was Ten\u201D (co-penned by Feller), all of which showcased her child-like soprano.

George Copeland Ault (October 11, 1891 &ndash; December 30, 1948) was an American painter. He was loosely grouped with the Precisionist movement and, though influenced by Cubism and Surrealism, his most lasting work is of a realist nature. Ault was born in Cleveland, Ohio into a wealthy family and spent his youth in London, England, where he studied at the Slade School of Art and St. John's Wood School of Art. Returning to the United States in 1911, he spent the rest of his life in New York and New Jersey. His personal life henceforth was very troubled. He became alcoholic during the 1920s, after the death of his mother in a mental institution. Each of his three brothers committed suicide, two after the loss of the family fortune in the 1929 stock market crash. In 1937, Ault moved to Woodstock, New York and tried to put his difficulties in the past. Depending on his wife for income, he created some of his finest paintings during this time, but had difficulty selling them. In 1948, he apparently committed suicide by drowning. In his lifetime, his works were displayed at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Addison Gallery of American Art, among others. Ault worked in oil, watercolor, and pencil. He is often grouped with Precisionist painters such as Charles Sheeler and Ralston Crawford because of his unadorned representations of architecture and urban landscapes. However, the ideological aspects of Precisionism and the unabashed modernism of his influences are not so apparent in his work\u2014for instance, he once referred to skyscrapers as the \"tombstones of capitalism\" and considered the industrialized American city \"the Inferno without the fire\" (Fryd, 57). Ault painted what he saw around him, simplifying detail slightly into flat shapes and planes, and portraying the underlying geometric patterns of structures. An analytical painter and ultimately a realist, he was especially noted for his realistic portrayal of light\u2014especially the light of darkness\u2014for he commonly painted nighttime scenes. Of his later paintings, such as January, Full Moon; Black Night; August Night; and Bright Light at Russell's Corners (pictured), The New York Times wrote:

Bellows spent most of his remaining career in New York, though he briefly moved to Boston. He visited Europe again in 1867. In New York he kept a studio in the same building as many of the notable Hudson River School artists of the time. His landscape work of the 1860s is fully in the late Hudson River School tradition, though Bellows depicted people more prominently in his landscapes than most other artists. He excelled at figurative scenes. Bellows also differed from most Hudson River School artists in that he became skilled at watercolor, and authored a respected book on the subject titled \"Water-Color Painting: Some Facts and Authorities in Relation to Its Durability\".

James Carter is credited as a performer on the soundtrack of the film O Brother, Where Art Thou?, despite not being a professional singer. As of 1959, Carter was serving time at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Lambert for charges unknown. In a southern field excursion at Camp B, Carter and the other prisoners in his chain gang were spending the day chopping wood. Carter began singing an old spiritual, \"Po' Lazarus\", and the other prisoners joined in, chopping the logs in time to the music. Folk music historian Alan Lomax happened to be present at the time, and was able to take a photograph of the prisoners and make a recording of the music, which he donated to a music archive. Decades later, the recording was purchased for use in the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack, which went on to win a Grammy for Album of the Year. During this, it was discovered by the producers that Carter was still alive, and they successfully tracked him down. Despite never seeing the film and, understandably, not even remembering the song he had sung over 40 years previous, Carter was pleased with the album's success, and was present at the benefit concert held in Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, which featured repeat performances by the other performers from the soundtrack (although Carter himself did not perform). As the other prisoners have not been identified (and likely never will be), the official credit for the artist on the soundtrack is for \"James Carter &amp; the Prisoners\". Carter died November 26, 2003, in Chicago, at age 77.

Frederick Arthur Bridgman (November 10, 1847 &ndash; January 13, 1928) was an American artist, born in Tuskegee, Alabama. An American Southerner, born in Tuskeegee, Alabama, the son of a physician, Bridgman would become one of the United States' most well-known and well-regarded painters and become known as one of the world's most talented \"Orientalist\" painters. He began as a draughtsman in New York City, for the American Bank Note Company in 1864-1865, and studied art in the same years at the Brooklyn Art Association and at the National Academy of Design; but he went to Paris in 1866 and became a pupil of Jean-L\u00E9on G\u00E9r\u00F4me. Paris then became his headquarters. A trip to Egypt in 1873-1874 resulted in pictures of the East that attracted immediate attention, and his large and important composition, The Funeral Procession of a Mummy on the Nile, in the Paris Salon (1877), bought by James Gordon Bennett, brought him the Cross of the Legion of Honor. Other paintings by him were An American Circus in Normandy, Procession of the Bull Apis, and a Rumanian Lady (in the Temple collection, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). In 1867, Bridgman entered the studio of the noted academic painter Jean-L\u00E9on G\u00E9r\u00F4me (1824-1904), where he was deeply influenced by G\u00E9r\u00F4me's precise draftsmanship, smooth finishes, and concern for Middle-Eastern themes. (Bridgman would even become known as \"the American G\u00E9r\u00F4me. \") No mere imitator, however, Bridgman would later adopt a more naturalistic aesthetic, emphasizing bright colors and painterly brushwork. Bridgman made his first trip to North Africa between 1872 and 1874, dividing his time between Algeria and Egypt. There he executed approximately three hundred sketches, which became the source material for several later oil paintings. Additional visits to the region throughout the 1870s and 1880s allowed him to amass a collection of costumes, architectural pieces, and objets d'art, which often appear in his paintings. (Amusingly, John Singer Sargent noted that Bridgman's overstuffed studio, along with the Eiffel Tower, were Paris's must-see attractions. ) Though Bridgman maintained a lifelong connection to France, his popularity in America never waned. Indeed, in 1890, the artist had a one-man show of over 400 pictures in New York's 5th Avenue galleries. When the show moved to Chicago's Art Institute, it contained only 300 works - testimony to the high number of sales Bridgman had made. One of Bridgman's most recognized Orientalist images, \"A Street Scene in Algeria\", is exceptional for its biographical and historical significance. Many of its details can be considered \"signature\" motifs of the artist, and its subject, a pointed record of travel. In keeping with Bridgman's tendency in the 1880s to focus on intimate domestic subjects, two seated male figures are given pride of place in the center of the composition, gesticulating while they chat. Recently, works by the painter have sold at auction in the price range of $250,000 USD to $350,000 USD.

New International Encyclopedia He was its vice-president, 1899-1904, and originated the idea of the removal of the Academy to a new site in 110th Street. In 1866 he became one of the charter members of the Water-Color Society, of which he was president from 1887 to 1904. He generally confined himself to representations of street child life, bootblacks, newsboys, etc. ; his Passing Show (Paris, Salon, 1877) and Street Boys at Play (Paris Exhibition, 1900) are good examples of his popular talent.

Baccharis is a genus of perennials and shrubs in the family Asteraceae. They are commonly known as baccharises but sometimes referred to as \"brooms\", because many members have small thin leaves resembling the true brooms. They are not at all related to these however, but belong to an entirely different lineage of eudicots. B. halimifolia is commonly known as \"groundsel bush\", and in fact Baccharis is in the same family as the true groundsels, Senecio. The 250-400 species occur throughout the Americas. The genus is named after Bacchus, the Roman god of wine. If present, the leaves are borne along the stems in alternate fashion. Flowers are usually white or pinkish. There are no ray flowers, but many disk flowers (which are staminate) and pistillate flowers.
Baileya (the desert marigolds) is a genus of three species in the aster family Asteraceae. All are native to the southwestern United States and to Mexico. They are typically annual, though B. multiradiata may be perennial. The leaves, which may range from being entire to deeply lobed, mostly occur in a basal cluster. From this arises several flower stems, up to 18 inches (50 cm) in height, usually carrying a single yellow radiate flower each, although B. pauciradiata may have 2-3 flowers on a stem. Desert marigolds typically have their main bloom in the spring, extending through July. Summer thundershowers may enable a second bloom in October and even into November. Baileya species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Schinia miniana (which feeds exclusively on the genus) and Schinia pallicincta (which feeds exclusively on B. pauciradiata). The genus is named after US microscopist and West Point professor Jacob Whitman Bailey (1811-1857).
